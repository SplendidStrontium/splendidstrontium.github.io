### // STRAUD MANSION //

<BR><I>At the STRAUD MANSION, alone in the basement apartment, is the young vampire MANDARC.</i>

<i>On his phone trickles a number of messages between his Master and CEDRIC.</i>

<i>But his attention isn't there.</i>

<i>He opens a well-worn letter, paper slightly stiff and yellowing.</i>

<br>Dear Svetlana Oborovsky,

Thank you so much for your reading this week. You really make the subject matter come alive. If it weren't for you, I doubt I would be reading much at all lately. I used to read a lot when I was a girl and I'm so happy to get back into it.

> YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT I DON'T CONSIDER DEATH AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT.

#### STRAUD

> [interj.] AND YET YOU HID IT FROM ME. YOU BELIEVED IT TO BE THEFT.

> AND YOU TOOK IT ANYWAY.

<BR><I>SVETLANA had come to the MANSION with nothing but what would be considered her personal effects. She had been wearing a generous coat; tucked into one of the pockets were a number of letters that she had apparently been carrying around in sentimentality. </i>

<i>The letters were creased and well-worn with age.</i>

#### STRAUD

> BELIEF IS A POWERFUL THING, MANDARC.
