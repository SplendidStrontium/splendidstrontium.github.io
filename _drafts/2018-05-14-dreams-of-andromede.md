	* _Sense Star(Astrology)_

* **Domestics**
	* _Brush_
		* bits of dust are herded around. What brooms do falls into this category.

	* _Condense_
		* caster gathers latent water vapor to condense an orb between their palms approx 3in diameter
* **Evocation**

		* target object glows dimly, eg an ember's glow, or if concentrated, a pocket flashlight or laser pointer. Quality of existing light may be changed, such as to make something appear another color.
	* _Sound_
		* sound emits from local location, ie throwing one's voice; the sound may be anything in memory, but sound volume/pitch are around caster's natural abilities
* **Gastronomy**
	* _Affect Taste_
		* caster changes taste of a food. Smell is neutralized.
	* _Pop_
		* pressure in a sealed container of a familiar food changes rapidly to cause, ie, a corked wine bottle to explode

* **Invoke Runes**
	* _Create Inscription_
		* caster evokes magical writing, visible only by magical means.
