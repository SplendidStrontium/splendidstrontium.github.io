Wearing a doll's suit and tie<br/>
on your third birthday.<br/>
A priest who never knew you<br/>
mumbles.<br/>
Fill-in-the-blank eulogy--<br/>
 Name of deceased?<br/>
 Age of deceased?<br/>
 Circumstance of death?<br/>
 here,<br/>
 here,<br/>
 and here.

No blanks left<br/>
to speak of<br/>
leaky dollar store goggles<br/>
first crush with buckteeth<br/>
dinosaur fossils from the yard<br/>
 --summer dreams--<br/>
 dead before spring came.

Everyone knows it (I think)<br/>
but instead of mourning,<br/>
silence.<br/>
Fermenting black rows<br/>
listen to a clergyman<br/>
read from cue cards.

We should be counted among the dead.
