In Queens, the nighttime calm is dispelled. A fire lit means disaster for the Zhou family.

Seven//
Cedric, where are you? Our house is on fire!

Cedric//
Did you call 911?

Seven//
You want me to call the police?

Cedric//
YES

There is a pause, but it quickly passes. Cedric needs to get from one side of Queens to the other, and he will, because he's been summoned. He is needed.

It has been quiet over these past few months, since the massacre at Gravesend. Trelaine has been silent, licking his wounds. Was this his first action of revenge? Cedric has no idea, but at this moment the first thing to his mind is that he must come to the aid of his family.

The car doesn't let him down, he zooms in and out of traffic. Normally he'd consider it rude to rush in such a way, dangerous even. But today is an unusual occasion. Every minute is of the essence.

He can't help but suspect it's Trelaine. Fire was a death sentence to mortal and supernatural alike, but represented a particular risk to nightfolk. It was one of the few ways they could suffer death. The fact that his family would be targeted filled him with rage beyond belief. 

Finally he arrives at the scene. The Zhou family, all four of them, were huddled together in blankets outside the family home. Cedric exits his car and runs toward the gathering. 

Cedric//
Are you OK? 

Seven//
As OK as we can be. We all got out alright.
