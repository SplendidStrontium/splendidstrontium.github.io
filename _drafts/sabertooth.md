Many eons ago, before Man took the wilds from the animals, there were the sabertooth cats. The cats were the masters of the earth and all feared them. The last TwinFang was born during the time of great Sun, vast flat plains made prey easy to catch. In his youth he played with his brothers and sisters and was a friend to sister and stranger alike. As he grew, he did as his forefathers had always done and left play for tooth and claw. He took up fighting in the endless war and killed any who was not his kin, be they Cat or Prey. He took many wives and his clan hungered for nothing. 

The years began to pass and the earth dried up. Where no grass grew, no grazers roamed. The last TwinFang wandered but he cound find none but his cousins. He returned home but found himself taken by fits of weeping, no longer able to sing and dance as Cats of Lore did. But a sabercat is not made for weeping. 

Embarrased to have become useless to his tribe, the last TwinFang wandered until he found the largest valley he had ever seen; trees and brushes only feathered the horizon. There, he laid down and without his children to keep him warm or blood to fill his heart, he took again to despair.
