SETTING: 'TZU PRANO'S MAGICADEMY'<br/>
YEAR: 2021, spring

<center>~</center>

It is a rainy day. Again.

AEGWAIN, on the command of KEVIN MARSCAPONE, has turned out all the students of the Magicademy and refused to take on any more students. It was a short-lived second wind for the school of magic.

EMILIA ERNEST has taken her son and left, bound for places west. AEGWAIN is sleeping alone but she's chosen a different resting place. A large bed in the basement, covered with a large quilt. 

She is stirred from sleep by the sound of a UNKNOWN WOMAN wailing in grief, but from the basement, it's impossible to tell what exactly she is saying.
