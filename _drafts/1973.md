matter collides.<br/>
collapses.<br/>
ignites.<br/>
with these hands<br/>
God creates the stars.

fusion<br/>
atom by atom<br/>
cell by cell<br/>
His silent creations<br/>
burn blue.

man<br/>
has made<br/>
their decision<br/>
God's testimony unheard;<br/>
the court of man reigns supreme.

man turns to new faith in<br/>
filicide<br/>
deicide<br/>
and soon,<br/>
suicide.

unsteady adherents ignore<br/>
stars paled by fluorescents<br/>
reflecting in the scalpel.

needles and pills<br/>
in their wake<br/>
leave death.

blasphemers stir<br/>
a cacophony<br/>
where discordant voices<br/>
cannot speak.
