<p id="op-intro"><i>Orbis Sensualium Pictus</i> is a textbook for children written by John Amos Comenius, published in 1658. It was first written in Latin and German and later translated into many other European languages. I first encountered the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28299/28299-h/28299-h.htm">Orbis Pictus</a> at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> during a survey of works in the public domain. In January 2020, I started a translation of this work into modern English and simplified Chinese. I will be leaving the Latin as is.</p>
