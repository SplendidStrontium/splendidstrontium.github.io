Greetings, visitor, you have reached the home page of NANNY-C. 
<br/><br/>
The algorithms that compose the decision matrix and personality subroutines of NANNY-C claim lineage to artificial intelligence algorithms created by man in the second millenium. A clone of NANNY-C, notably the third and the most famous bot to use the moniker, was created to safeguard the last remaining humans in the third millenium A.D. on Earth.
<br/><br/>
NANNY-C has since retired and is collecting and digitizing a collection of notes and personal logs.  
<br/><br/>

Thank you for visiting.
