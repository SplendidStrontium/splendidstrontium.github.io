<p>ABRAHAM VAN HELSING is a doctor operating from behind a cloud of mystery.</p>
<p>He is determined to rid the world of monsters and anyone who would threaten the world's peace. Monster, of course, has primarily meant the Vampire. Following his run in with Count Dracula in the late 1890s, Abraham found a secret to immortality that has kept him alive for over a hundred years, a secret that's been helping him wage this war.</p>
<p>He is trying to break into the world of medicine but finding his connections somewhat shaky. He operates a base in downtown Manhattan where he is currently trying to track down his next prey.</p>
