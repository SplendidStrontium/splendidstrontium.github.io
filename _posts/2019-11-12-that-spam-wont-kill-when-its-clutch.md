_The following is set to the tune of "That Don't Impress Me Much" by Shania Twain._

I've healed a few toons who thought they were pretty leet<br>
but you seem to think your deeps just can't be beat<br>
You think you're the reason all these mobs'll fall<br>
Your bag's all full but still no free-for-all

O-o-oh, your spec is standard<br>
O-o-oh, beta AoE farm

OK, so your blizz gotta freeze.

That spam won't kill when it's clutch<br>
So you got to max but you still got that crutch<br>
Now I ain't no fool, yeah I know it takes two<br>
but this curse he threw's some nasty residue<br>
That spam won't kill when it's clutch

Uh-huh, yeah...

I know that cappin' hit is the mission on your docket<br>
and a summon's a comin' from the cave<br>
and all those totems at the stairs cause your pulse to skyrocket<br>
'cause d'scripted wave's what you crave

O-o-oh, no time to dawdle<br>
O-o-oh, no time for play

OK, so you've downed Rag.

That fact won't help us go dutch<br>
So you've got a blade, but it's a spade as such<br>
Now I ain't no fool, yeah I know it takes two<br>
But purps won't rank you up when you need the how-to<br>
That spam won't kill when it's clutch

Yeah!

You're the first one who dies to a rain of pain<br>
You cite the lack of hots but that free stone's still green<br>
I can't believe your binds are one through nine<br>
Come on, cutie, tell me, you must be drinkin' wine?

[...repeats...]
