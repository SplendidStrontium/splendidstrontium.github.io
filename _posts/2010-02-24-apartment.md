holes in the walls
crumbled drywall cowering
cold air trickles in

a shattered dish
in the corner
sharp edges shrieked
and now lay silenced

the fridge is missing a foot
can't stand up straight
there's a dent in the right side

black electrical tape
holding up bathroom tile
where the soap dish isn't

missing a knob
a hinge hangs useless
the bathroom door
bent in the middle
as if perforated
waiting
to be put out of misery

from the pop can
reborn as an ashtray
the air is becoming opaque
trying, trying not to choke

i pretended not to see
the roach scuttling
toward the trash can

he offers me the last draw
i politely refuse
i can't stop staring
at the ashes
that fell on the floor
