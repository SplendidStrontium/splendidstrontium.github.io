holes in the walls<br/>
crumbled drywall cowering<br/>
cold air trickles in<br/>

a shattered dish<br/>
in the corner<br/>
sharp edges shrieked<br/>
and now lay silenced<br/>

the fridge is missing a foot<br/>
can't stand up straight<br/>
there's a dent in the right side<br/>

black electrical tape<br/>
holding up bathroom tile<br/>
where the soap dish isn't<br/>

missing a knob<br/>
a hinge hangs useless<br/>
the bathroom door<br/>
bent in the middle<br/>
as if perforated<br/>
waiting<br/>
to be put out of misery<br/>

from the pop can<br/>
reborn as an ashtray<br/>
the air is becoming opaque<br/>
trying, trying not to choke<br/>

i pretended not to see<br/>
the roach scuttling<br/>
toward the trash can<br/>

he offers me the last draw<br/>
i politely refuse<br/>
i can't stop staring<br/>
at the ashes<br/>
that fell on the floor<br/>
