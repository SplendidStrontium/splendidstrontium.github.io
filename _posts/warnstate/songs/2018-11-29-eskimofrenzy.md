_The following is set to the tune of "Eleanor Rigby" by the Beatles._

Ah look at all the lonely heroes<br>
Ah look at all the lonely heroes

Eskimofrenzy sharpens his blades<br>
While the leet raiders pass<br>
They're all so crass<br>
Queues for the rando, wearing the hat<br>
With the gem he adores<br>
Who is it for?

All the lonely heroes<br>
Where do they all log on? x2

Fathermikemt, scribing a scroll<br>
With a stam buff that no one will read<br>
All cryptic creed<br>
Look at him working, preening his deeps<br>
In the night when there's nobody on<br>
Repair costs a ton

All the lonely heroes<br>
Where do they all log on? x2

Ah look at all the lonely heroes<br>
Ah look at all the lonely heroes

Eskimofrenzy, logged as a ghost<br>
And was left out along with his name<br>
Nobody fame<br>
Fathermikemt, nothing to boast<br>
just a creep's shady blast that was braved<br>
his rez was saved

All the lonely heroes<br>
Where do they all log on? x2
