_The following is set to the tune of "Ironic" by Alanis Morissette._

An old Gnoll peeked at his fate: teabags are steeping;<br>
one's done in a day.<br>
It's "agi" on your circl√©t<br>
It's a totem that's droppin' from a "dray-en-a"<br>
Isn't it nostalgic, don't ya think --

It's Morrowgrain after six hundred days<br>
It's a "B" of Free' when you're at HP 3<br>
It's the gold you lost 'cause o' no Elune's Grace ('n') <br>
U gave no Thott, it triggers

Sister Stay 'n' Strafe was too trained to cry<br>
She 'quipped her spirit gear, pissed away the rye...<br>
We waited the whole damn night to get that fight<br>
And as the raid dropped out, he thought,<br>
"We need some new mice..."<br>
And isn't it nostalgic, don't you think...

Crusaders three, who hate to pray<br>
The green mean who likes his champagne<br>
It's the group invite that got AFK fade<br>
Who would have thought, it withers...

Well, the Light has a funny way, of creepin' up in y' craw<br>
When y' think y' sub's long gone and any 'ding's a bell...<br>
Well, the Light has a funny way, floating on in when<br>
your head's on wrong and ev'ry spell goes to outer space...

Summon came inside of the gate / a nod to DKP gives your nerves a quake<br>
It's like twenty dubloons when all u want is a rare<br>
It's counting the span of my memes, but knowing there's nothing there...<br>
(repeat)
