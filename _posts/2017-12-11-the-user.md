> "Respect mah authoritah" --E. Cartman

I am not owned by my sysadmin.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1986, was a piece of legislation intended to prohibit accessing a computer without authorization, or in excess of authorization. 

Unwittingly, this gave supreme power to He who grants credentials; What is 'access', what is the nature of a network, and how much power should He have? I am my own superuser. It is I who gives permissions.

> (1) the term “computer” means an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device, but such term does not include an automated typewriter or typesetter, a portable hand held calculator, or other similar device;
