_The following is set to the tune of "Hit Me Baby" by Britney Spears._

Oh Priesty, Priesty; Oh Priesty, Priesty --

O Priesty, Priesty, how was I supposed to know<br>
the wizard isn't king here<br>
O Priesty, Priesty, I can't kill this mob so-lo --<br>
My soul is weak without you

Slow me, scream until you hurt me<br>
Shoot me, Priesty, wand until you're all at full mana

My lack o' stam is killin' me (and I)<br>
I must respec; I need resist (need resist)<br>
Without your instants I lose all time --<br>
Buff me Divine<br>
Fort me, Priesty, blue 'n' white

O Priesty, Priesty, the frame that I drain takes two<br>
Stun me now, I'm bonded<br>
O Holy Priesty, be-in' oom is not for you<br>
You play me while I'm farming

Burn me if you want me to leave<br>
Burn me priesty, 'cause I'm runnin' any, anyhow<br>
Dat Mind Control, it's killin' me (and I)<br>
I see the mess I did believe (did believe)<br>
When I'm not with you, the XP's mine<br>
Buff me Divine<br>
Fort me, Priesty, one more time

Oh Priesty, Priesty; Oh Priesty, Priesty<br>
How was I supposed to know?<br>
O Holy Priesty, I'll improve my shield 'n' go...<br>
I must confess, I ne'er read Tess; it's killin' me now...<br>
The pain you give is what I need<br>
When will you be here, and cleanse me this crime?<br>
Fort me, Priesty, one more time
