<I>How many days have passed since the death of Peggy Hill? <i>

<i>CEDRIC has been morose and quiet, unwilling to leave the flat. He's convinced himself that his presence is providing protection to his friends, lest there be any retaliatory strikes from the enemy.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">In the first scene, I'm back at a school.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But less like the training academy that was almost straight out of 'Bender's Game'. More like a traditional college.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The place is dimly lit, dark blues especially.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm sitting around a table of students making last minute preparations for their exams. I realize I've done none of the necessary studying for my Physics III exam. It's the third semester of an introductory sequence that I have the feeling I've been struggling with.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Another night, I'm in a school's library</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There are many students studying at the desks and tables but they're just part of the background.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm doing research, looking for a book that I'm confident exists.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But I can find no record of the book, either in this library or having existed anywhere.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I pour over record after record looking for this book but it's just not there.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I am determined to keep looking, though the only certainty I have that book exists is my own memory of it.</p>

<i>A few moments pass without response from STRAUD. </i>

<i>CEDRIC leaves the private chatroom and prepares to enter the main lobby. He fiddles with his hair absently, dreading contact with the old woman.</i>

<i>She's the most recent contact he's made in-person. Just a few days ago (had it been a week? or more?), he'd brought proof to her that her request had been completed.</i>

<i>Something about the hit had left him sapped of his usual energy.</i>

<i>And since then, he'd not wanted to see anyone, setting himself to pacing when his meditations were difficult to maintain.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">If the girl Meifeng had no contact with McCoy's coercion then she, too, went of her own free-will.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">We already know the Charm daughter has done everything short of adopting Gagarin as her mother.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Darrell, slime-that-he-is, speaks in favor of the Moongazers to every ear that's lent his way.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">While we waste time worrying about traditions and bloodlines, who knows what they're researching.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The realms of Elysion continue to fade at the edges.</p>
