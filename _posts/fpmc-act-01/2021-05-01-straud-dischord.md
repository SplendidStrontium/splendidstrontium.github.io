## // TOWER OF AZORA // ##

<I>When I get to the Tower of Azora, the Oborovsky twins are engaging in their daily music lessons.</i>

<i>Ever since the electricity was cut off from their apartment, the girls have been obligated to look through their mother's records and perform recitation from heart.</i>

<i>I used to get roped in to provide accompaniment for them. It was VINCE's job before that.</i>

<i>I had, a few years back, got up the nerve to tell SVETLANA that I could no longer keep up with the youngins and that she should look into hiring someone else.</i>

<i>But, she didn't listen to me (I should have known better) and instead bought the children an electric keyboard.</i>

<i>The thing isn't strung with animal gut so it's jazzy and discordant. Jarring, to say the least.</i>

<i>I. Hate. The. Sound.</i>

<i>But I know the girls will rage at me if their practice is interrupted. They get into the "groove" and I have found I get the best results with them if I just wait until they finish.</i>

<i>I take a deep breath and settle in for the wait. The walls of their brownstone are thin and sadly, I can hear every note.</i>

<i>This one is one of my favorites, hope it's one of yours.</i>

<I>She removes her cellular telephone from its holster and presses in a long sequence of digits. Even from the hallway, I can hear each depression.</i>

<i>There's no use trying to go in now. Exhausted from their performance, I won't be able to get through to them until after they've satisfied their sugar fix.</i>

<i>I hide in a closet and wait for the End.</i>

<I>Like clockwork, the young CANDY BEHR knocks on the door.</i>

### ESTHER ###

> O SHIT! SHE'S HERE!

### OPHELIA ###

> ROCK ON! IT'S PARTY TIME!

<I>The girls answer the door. CANDY is tall and thin. The tips of her hair are dyed pink. She wears hot pants.</i>

<i>She knocks on the door.</i>

<i>The girls answer.</i>

### BOTH ###

> CANDY! CANDY BEHR! HOW ARE YOU! WELCOME, WELCOME!

### CANDY BEHR ###

> HELLO, GIRLS. WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

### ESTHER ###

> WE NEED OUR SUGAR RUSH.

### CANDY BEHR ###

> SUGAR RUSH, HUH? WELL, THAT I CAN DO. I HAVE SOME YUMMY LOLLIPOPS...

### BOTH ###

> AW! LOLLYPOPS! GIMME GIMME GIMME!

<I>When CANDY lifts the goods from her sack, the twins tear it from her hands.</i>

<i>They are engrossed with licking the spiral-painted circles.</i>

<i>It doesn't take them long to get to the stems.</i>

<i>Impatient for digestion, they let loose with a giant:</i>

<center>CRRUNCH!</center>

<i>Satisfied with themselves, they look at each other and grin from ear-to-ear.</i>

### ESTHER ###

> OPHELIA. TELL ME. HOW MANY LICKS DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO THE CENTER OF A TOOTSY ROC?

### OPHELIA ###

> ONE FOR THE MONEY...

### BOTH ###

> AND TWO FOR THE SHOW!

<I>They erupt into cacophanous laughter.</i>

***** 

<i>I let them calm down from their high and wait until the domicile seems calm, collected.</i>

<i>They've given me a key so I slip open the door. But I know when entering the cave of krokodyle, it is wise, prudent, calm, even, to announce oneself.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> ESTHER? OPHELIA? ARE YOU TWO HOME?

<I>ESTHER whispers to OPHELIA. They think I can't hear them.</i>

### ESTHER ###

> (whispering) It's the old captain come to call.

### OPHELIA ###

> (whispering) That asshole better have our plasma 'r I'm gonna tear 'im a new one.

<i>They shuffle about in their pinafores and soon appear in front of me in their usual maquillage.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> GOOD AFTERNOON, GIRLS.

### BOTH ###

> GOOD AFTERNOON, VLAD.

### ESTHER ###

> YOU GOT THE GOODS?

### STRAUD ###

> I GOT THE GOODS.

### OPHELIA ###

> THANKS 4 COMING SO QUICKLY, VLAD. U'RE A REEL PAL.

### STRAUD ###

> I TRY.

### BOTH ###

> NEWS FROM THE UNDERGROUND?

### STRAUD ###

> O, IT'S BEEN A SLOW NEWS DAY. YOUR STEP-MOTHER SENDS HER REGARDS.

### ESTHER ###

> NO. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

### STRAUD ###

> I AM, LADIES. YOUR MOTHER IS LAID UP ON HER BLUE PERIOD.

### OPHELIA ###

> ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU ALWAYS WERE SUCH A JOKER.

### STRAUD ###

> NO, LADIES. IT'S TRUE. ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.

<I>They squeal, shrill; deafening.</i>

### ESTHER ###

> THAT, IS LIKE, SO TOTALLY...

### BOTH ###

> AWESOME!

### OPHELIA ###

> YOU ARE THE BEST, STRAUD!

### ESTHER ###

> THANKS FOR DOING US A SOLID!

### OPHELIA ###

> PSH-YEAH! I THOUGHT THE OL' BITCH WAS GONNA MAKE US CHANGE HER BEDCLOTHES.

### ESTHER ###

> LIKE, IF I HAD TO DIG ONE MORE BLOODY TAMPON OUT OF THE WASH, I WAS, LIKE, GONNA FLIP MY SHIT.

### OPHELIA ###

> PREACH IT, SISTA!

### STRAUD ###

> IT IS TRUE THAT THE POOR DOLL'S HYGIENE HABITS DID NOT LEAVE MUCH TO THE IMAGINATION.

### ESTHER ###

> TOTALLY GNARLY.

### OPHELIA ###

> GNARLY, DOOD.

<I>The two cackle, craven, crazed.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> I'LL LEAVE YOUR TREATS IN THE REFRIGERATOR. FOR WHENEVER YOU FEEL A LONGING.

<I>The two draw their opposite hands back from each other and meet in a clapping, elaborate chain of handshakes.</i>

### ESTHER ###

> UP HIGH!

### OPHELIA ###

> DOWN LOW!

### ESTHER ###

> SCORE!

### OPHELIA ###

> YOU GO, GIRL!

### STRAUD ###

> NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE MY EXCUSES, I MUST BE RUDE AND BEG YOUR LEAVING.

### ESTHER ###

> WHAT? YOU SKIPPIN' TOWN?

### STRAUD ###

> I'M AFRAID SO.

### OPHELIA ###

> AW. THAT'S A BUMMER. WE JUS' GETTIN' STARTED!

### STRAUD ###

> I KNOW. PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW.

<I>I walk over to the fridge and open it. Inside is a plethora of quick meals.</i>

<i>When I step back into the room, the girls are collapsed, eyes glazed, staring at the boob toob. It's a grotesque scene, but it is the one vocation at which the girls were at peace.</i>

<i>The only motion in the room comes from the rhythmic mashing of OPHELIA's teeth upon her chewing gum.</i>

<i>I finally leave the room and lock up.</i>

<i>A smile breaks upon my face when I receive a surprise.</i>
