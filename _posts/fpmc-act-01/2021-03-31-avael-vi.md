<p class="ppl-sez">I dreamt that I, and everyone else on Earth, had been tricked.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">We all suffered a sort of reverse double-vision.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I had to strain, staring at myself in a mirror -- but it revealed that I, and presumably, all humans on Earth -- had two heads -- two faces.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A second neck grew from our shoulders. There was no longer a head in the center, but two that grew out from each other.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">You don't fear the sun.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But you need to fear anyone who might have known you before. They could expose you for who you are. We can't erase every record of death.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">'Have I seen this before?'</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">you'll ask.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But you must remind yourself that the déjà vu is a symbol of the simplistic primate brain in which we find ourselves imprisoned.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There are no such things as repeats in the infinite Count of time's river. Prophecies simply us trying to grok a pattern we don't understand.</p>
