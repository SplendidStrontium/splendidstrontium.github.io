## // STRAUD MANSION // ##

<i>It is a rainy day in JAMAICA ESTATES. The sunlight trickles, filtered through dense cloudcover.</i>

<i>MANDARC has been trolling on the (w)IntraNet. His sparsely decorated apartment is in a tucked-away corner in the basement of the palatial estate. There is but one computer in the house, and it's in his apartment.</i>

<i>He's sat in on a conversation between CEDRIC and KEVIN concerning the matter of dreams.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> (thinking) Idle chatter.

<i>There are bigger mysteries MANDARC yearns to conquer. As a young vampire, there is so much about the world that he doesn't understand.</i>

<i>His Master, the Vampire VLADISLAUS STRAUD, has a knack for traveling about the house in near silence. MANDARC has no idea whether he's awake or not; at the very least, he was not present for the discussion on the (w)IntraNet.</i>

<i>MANDARC reluctantly leaves the privacy of his basement lair and takes the long walk upstairs.</i>

<i>He finds STRAUD, listening to the noisebox on the first floor.</i>

<i>Before speaking, he stands in silence, remembering a tale the Old Man wove of his origin -- an orphan found by monks in the early medieval period. That makes him far older than any Vampire he knows, even older than the Vampire he once claimed as his Sire: the elder McCOY.</i>

<i>But he can't escape the suspicion that the Old Man knows more than he lets on.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> EXCUSE ME, MASTER.

> MIGHT I A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME?

<I>STRAUD pauses, still, back still turned to MANDARC. He walks over toward the jukebox and turns a large dial to the OFF position.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> OF COURSE.

### MANDARC ### 

> I WANT TO DISCUSS THE PLASMA FRUIT.

<I>STRAUD turns around to face MANDARC.</I>

### STRAUD ###

> (slowly) THE PLASMA FRUIT.

> YES.

> WELL.

> START WITH WHAT YOU KNOW.

<I>MANDARC often tired of STRAUD's pedantic, even patronizing approach.</i>

<i>In a precise impatience, he prepares to deliver his paltry understanding of the strange foodstuff.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> THE PLASMA FRUIT TREE WAS DEVELOPED BY THE ELDER VAMPIRE VATORE.

> HE GREW IT ON HIS ESTATE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

> HE CLAIMED IT WAS A CULTIVAR OF THE APPLE, MALUS DOMESTICA, ALTHOUGH IN OBSERVATION, THE FRUIT SEEMS TO RESEMBLE MORE CLOSELY THE PEACH, PRUNUS PERSICA.

> CERTAINLY IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LARGE INTERNAL PIT IS INEDIBLE, A FEATURE LACKING IN THE CONTEMPORARY MALUS DOMESTICA.

<I>STRAUD, seemingly satisfied with MANDARC's introduction, interrupts the young man.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> LET US WORK BACKWARDS.

> THE APPLE REPRESENTS KNOWLEDGE.

> IT IS A GIFT FROM THE EIGEN.

> IT THRIVES ON NATURAL SUNLIGHT.

> IT IS THE METHOD BY WHICH THE EIGEN GIVE US THE LIGHT OF MIND.

<I>MANDARC is jittery and irritated.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE EIGEN.

### STRAUD ###

> ONLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE SYSTEM OF BELIEF THAT THE DOCTOR INTRODUCED TO YOU.

> BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT YOU LACK SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE NOR DISPROVE THEIR EXISTENCE.

### MANDARC ###

> WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING JUST SOUNDS LIKE A PERVERSION OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ORIGIN MYTH.

<I>STRAUD's thin lips curl ever-so-slightly.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> YOUNG PEOPLES OF EARTH TRYING TO DEMYSTIFY THEIR WORLD.

> AS ALWAYS, THEY GET SOME THINGS RIGHT AND SOME THINGS WRONG.

<I>MANDARC struggles for a witty retort.</i>

> I FIND IT TERRIBLY PESSIMISTIC TO BELIEVE THAT OUR OWN DAMPENED SENSES SHOULD BE THE END OF INQUIRY.

> THEY ARE NOT THE END, BUT THE BEGINNING.

<I>STRAUD raises his hand to point, strangely, at a spot in the center of MANDARC's face.</i>

> YOUR EYES LIMIT YOU TO A FORCED PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE ALWAYS UNKNOWNS JUST BY VIRTUE OF OBSERVATION.

<I>MANDARC backs away, unnerved by the gesture.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> YOU MEAN THE ANALOGY OF THE CAT?

### STRAUD ###

> NOT PRECISELY.

<I>STRAUD looks toward the fireplace, freeing MANDARC from his gaze.</i>

> BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT, WE CAN.

<I>But the moment of respite is just that, and STRAUD returns his eyes to the young vampire.</i>

> WOULD YOU PREFER TO LIVE IN A UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE CAT IS ALIVE, DEAD, OR NEITHER?

> LIKE YOU, MANDARC. WE ARE NEITHER DEAD, NOR ALIVE.

<I>The Elder shifts about, uncomfortable.</i>

> THAT'S WHY IT INFURIATES ME WHEN OUR FRIEND CEDRIC INSISTS THAT HE IS DEAD. 

> WE SO CLEARLY LIVE IN A REALITY NEITHER DEAD NOR ALIVE.

<I>CEDRIC is the last thing MANDARC wants to discuss. It's no secret that STRAUD has taken him as his favorite son.</i>

<i>And who had taken him as their Golden Child?</i>

### MANDARC ###

> I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN A BIT FAR AFIELD.

### STRAUD ###

> NOTHING IS DEAD OR LIVING. IT SIMPLY DISSIPATES.

### MANDARC ###

> BUT THERE IS CHANGE OF STATE.

### STRAUD ###

> YES. 

> AND THERE IS ALSO REFLECTION, WHAT SOME CALL AN EVENT, BY WHICH THE PROCESS OF DISSIPATION IS SPED.

> TAKE THE PLASMA FRUIT TREE FOR EXAMPLE.

> IT REMAINS STAGNANT IN THE SUN'S LIGHT BUT IS NURTURED BY THE PHOTONS REFLECTED BY EARTH'S MOON.

> CLEARLY ONE IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER, THOUGH BOTH ARE RECOGNIZED BY SCIENCE TO BE PHOTONS.

> THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN BURNS YOUR FLESH BUT YOU CAN BATHE FREELY IN THE AMBIENT GLOW OF DISTANT GALAXIES AND STARS.

<I>MANDARC furls his brow, seeing the commentary as childish and obvious.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME NOR SUFFICIENT FLUX FOR IT TO HURT.

> I'M SURE THE MOONLIGHT WOULD BURN ME TOO, IF IT WERE BRIGHTER; IF THE NIGHT LASTED LONG ENOUGH.

### STRAUD ###

> EVERYTHING OF THIS WORLD IS A GIFT, MANDARC.

> NOTHING IS CREATED, EARNED, DOMINATED.

> A SIMPLE COVERING OF STONE PROTECTS YOU FROM THE INTENSE HEAT, A FIRE THAT IS SIMPLY -- UNNATURAL.

> WHAT OF THE REST OF THE EMITTED RADIATION? YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THERE.

> WHAT YOU REJECT SEEMS TO BE NOT THAT WHICH YOU CANNOT SEE, BUT RATHER THAT WHAT YOU CAN SEE POSSESSES A WILL, A MISSION, A SOUL.

<I>STRAUD pauses dramatically, and his tone seems playfully scornful, surprising MANDARC in its almost duplicitous implication.</i>

> AND YET YOU BELIEVE IN THE DREAMSPACE PURPORTED TO EXIST BY VINCENT MARSCAPONE AND OUR FRIEND CEDRIC.

<I>Such verbal combat strikes MANDARC off-balance.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> I'M NOT SURE WHAT I BELIEVE.

<I>STRAUD continues, confident.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> PERHAPS THE DREAMSPACE IS SIMPLY A FANTASY OF A BRAIN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ITSELF -- A NAME GRANTED TO AN IMPRINT LEFT BEHIND BY THE PSEUDO-RANDOM ELECTRICAL IMPULSES THAT CLEANSE THE MEMORIES AT NIGHT.

> THE (pause) "DEFRAGMENTATION" AND REORGANIZATION OF THE DATA HELD BY NEURONS.

> EVEN THE SIMPLEST OF PLANTS STRUGGLE TO GROW WITHOUT A CYCLE OF REST.

> I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR RETICENCE TO CREATE AN IDEA NOT BACKED UP BY YOUR OWN SENSES.

> BUT WHAT TROUBLES ME IS YOUR FEAR OF NAMING.

> EVEN IF THE EIGEN DO NOT EXIST, WHAT DO I LOSE BY GIVING A NAME TO THAT WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

> DO YOU THINK THE EARTHICANS, EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THEY'VE SEEN MIRACLES WORKED, REFUSE THE WORD "MAGIC"?

<I>MANDARC, head drifting toward the floor, looks upward over his eyeglasses at STRAUD.</i>

> OF COURSE SOME OF THEM DO, BUT WHAT DO THEY GAIN FROM IT?

> FEAR OF A NAME INCREASES FEAR OF THE THING ITSELF.

### MANDARC ###

> YOU'RE QUOTING.

### STRAUD ###

> AND YOU SHOULD HOLD YOUR TONGUE.
