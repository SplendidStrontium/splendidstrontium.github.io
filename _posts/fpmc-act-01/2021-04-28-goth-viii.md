## // OLD GOTH ESTATE // ##

<i>When LARRY gets to the Goth Mansion, he is afraid. Very afraid.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA GOTH, CASSANDRA GOTH. He was just vaguely familiar with the name. But he knew naught about her except that her family was old money.</i>

<i>Her mother was a spellcaster, of course, but she'd kept the secret from her children. As was the way in their family.</i>

<i>But what KEVIN had said... A northern princess? He'd thought he'd before heard a rumor that the old missus GOTH was dead.</i>

<i>Of course, he'd seen no proof, so he couldn't be sure.</i>

<i>37 Ascot had shown itself to be nearby, so he'd decided to walk. No use giving up his parking spot. Besides, a little exercise never hurt.</i>

<i>LARRY knocks on the door and he swears he hears a howl in the distance. Or is it a mourning dove? But... it couldn't be...?</i>

<i>When he finally reaches the address, he eyes the mansion. It is a sprawling house with a huge garden. A red car is stationary in the car park.</i>

<i>He stands on the sidewalk, reticent.</i>

<i>"Don't humiliate yourself," KEVIN had said. He only hopes he can succeed the request.</i>

<i>His arrival is pre-empted by a blonde woman who exits the front door. Her hair is long and drawn into a braid she wears over her shoulder.</i>

<i>LARRY stands still, permits her approach.</i>

<i>She opens the gate adjoining the sidewalk.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> AH. YOU MUST BE THE YOUNG LARRY.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> UH, YES.

<I>He stammers.</i>

> I AM CALLED LARRY POTTER.

### LUCIA ###

> YES. THAT IS YOUR NAME. 

> THE ELDER MYRTLE MARSCAPONE HAS TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.

<I>LARRY swallows the spit pooling in his mouth.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> YES, MA'AM.

### LUCIA ###

> IT'S GOOD YOU'VE ARRIVED.

> WE'RE HAVING A BIT OF A GHOST PROBLEM AND THE MATRON LET ME KNOW THAT WAS A BIT OF A SPECIALITY OF YOURS.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, MA'AM... I HAVEN'T BEEN AN AUROR FOR MANY YEARS.

### LUCIA ###

> YEARS, HUH?

> WELL, TOUGH TIMES CALL FOR TOUGH MEASURES.

> NOW THAT BELLA GOTH AND MYRTLE MARSCAPONE ARE DEAD, THE TASK FALLS TO YOU.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> THE TASK FALLS TO ME?

<I>LARRY is unsure how she knows about the death of the HEADMISTRESS but -- perhaps it had taken him longer to get here than he thought.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> YES, LARRY. WE HAVE A GHOST PROBLEM.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> GHOSTS, MA'AM?

### LUCIA ###

> YES, LARRY. A GHOST PROBLEM. 

> MYRTLE TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNE WITH THE DEAD.

> ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPLY THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE?

<I>LARRY tries to regain his composure.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> NO! NO, MA'AM. I AM MORE THAN CAPABLE!

### LUCIA ###

> GOOD.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I... JUST...

### LUCIA ###

> YOU JUST... WHAT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT TO...

### LUCIA ###

> DIDN'T EXPECT TO WHAT?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> TO COMMUNE UNTIL I'D SEEN A FEW MORE YEARS.

### LUCIA ###

> WE HAVE NEED OF YOU. NOW.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I... I SEE.

### LUCIA ###

> NOW. BE A GOOD LITTLE BOY AND GO INSIDE AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO THE LADY OF THE HOUSE.

> SHE'S GENTLE, IF A BIT GLOOMY. I'M SURE THE TWO OF YOU WILL GET ALONG JUST FINE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WHAT... WHAT IS SHE LIKE? WHAT... DOES SHE LIKE?

### LUCIA ###

> I COULDN'T SAY LARRY.

> WHY DON'T YOU GO IN AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF?

> NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, IT'S TIME FOR MY NIGHTLY. PLEASE, LEAVE US.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> YES, MA'AM.

<I>LARRY allows LUCIA her leaving and walks up the steps to the front door. It is set diagonally to the floorprint of the house. </i>

<i>Suddenly, he has a longing for times long past.</i>

<i>But he muscles past his fears and knocks on the door.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA GOTH, with her raven hair long about her shoulders, answers the door with a gun in hand.</i>

<i>LARRY raises his hands in surrender.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> OH MY GOD! PLEASE DON'T SHOOT!

<I>CASSANDRA holds her gun firm but slowly lowers it as the man seems to bring no appreciable threat.</i>

<i>She speaks.</i>

### CASSANDRA ###

> WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I'M LARRY POTTER!

> YOU CALLED ABOUT A GHOST PROBLEM?

### CASSANDRA ###

> I...

<I>She pauses a moment, thinking, cautious.</i>

> WHY... YES. I... DID. CALL ABOUT A GHOST INFESTATION.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> LARRY POTTER EXTRANATURAL EXTERMINATION SERVICES, AT YOUR COMMAND, MADAM.

> PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ANY SIMILARITY, REAL OR IMPLIED, BETWEEN SIMILIAR COMPANIES IS MERELY COINCIDENCE.

### CASSANDRA ###

> ... MERELY... COINCIDENCE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> THAT'S THE FINE PRINT.

> BOILERPLATE, IF YOU WILL.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I... SEE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> PLEASE STATE THE NATURE OF YOUR MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

### CASSANDRA ###

> WHAT?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> PLEASE STATE THE NATURE --... OH TO HELL WITH IT.

> WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF GHOST INFESTATION?

### CASSANDRA ###

> WELL, YOU SEE... 

> THERE ARE THESE STRANGE DOLLS THAT KEEP APPEARING IN MY HOUSE AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH MY ROOMMATE AND THEY'RE NOT HERS. NEITHER OF US KEEP COMPANY AND I DOUBLE-LOCK THE DOORS EACH NIGHT.

> WE EVEN HAVE A SECURITY SYSTEM.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I UNDERSTAND. SO WE CAN RULE OUT ESPIONAGE.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I WOULD THINK SO.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> HOW OLD IS THIS HOUSE?

### CASSANDRA ###

> HOW OLD?

> WELL, IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S; BEFORE THAT I'M NOT REALLY SURE. I'VE HAD TO HAVE A FEW THINGS RE-WIRED AND IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T COME WITH ETHERNET...

### LARRY POTTER ###

> SEPTIC OR SEWER?

### CASSANDRA ###

> ... SEWER.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> GOOD, GOOD. THAT AT LEAST ELIMINATES PART OF THE PROBLEM.

### CASSANDRA ###

> EE... YEAH.

> I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH...

### LARRY POTTER ###

> MAY I COME IN AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE ISSUE?

### CASSANDRA ###

> UH... OF COURSE.

<I>CASSANDRA steps out of the doorway and allows LARRY entrance. She walks over to the wall and flips a switch to allow for additional light.</i>

> I TOOK OVER STEWARDSHIP OF THE HOME AFTER MY MOTHER DIED A FEW YEARS BACK. IT WAS THREATENING TO GO FALLOW BEFORE THAT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, THE ELDERLY OFTEN STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMANDS OF HOME OWNERSHIP ONCE THEIR ENERGY BEGINS TO FAIL.

### CASSANDRA ###

> MY MOTHER WAS SO BUSY TAKING CARE OF ME AND MY BROTHER THAT I DON'T THINK IT LEFT HER MUCH TIME TO TEND TO GRAMMA'S OLD HOUSE. 

> I DOUBT THAT... PLEASED THE SPIRITS.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> NO, PROBABLY NOT.

> I DOUBT THAT THEY'RE ANGRY AT YOU; THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO REACH OUT TO YOU TO COMMUNICATE THEIR NEEDS. 

> ONCE FLED TO THE SPIRIT REALM, THEY TEND TO SPEAK THEIR NATIVE TONGUE. IF YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE, WELL, AS THEY SAY, TOUGH NOOGIES.

### CASSANDRA ###

> WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS AGAIN?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> LARRY. LARRY POTTER.

### CASSANDRA ###

> HUH. IT HAS A NICE RING TO IT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. I WANT TO PREPARE A CIRCLE OF RITUAL TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE AT FINDING AN AMENABLE SOUL.

<I>He adds, as an aside:</i>

> ONE THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH.

> AT WHAT TIME DO YOU NOTICE DISTURBANCES?

### CASSANDRA ###

> WHAT TIME? UH... I GUESS I HEAR NOISES IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM TIME TO TIME.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> EARLY MORNING, HUH.

### CASSANDRA ###

> YEAH, USUALLY. 

> BUT I CAN'T SAY IT'S ALWAYS RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN TIME OF DAY.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> REASONABLE.

> THE BEDROOMS ARE UPSTAIRS?

### CASSANDRA ###

> YEAH.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> OK. LET'S SET UP UPSTAIRS.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>Soon, LARRY has unloaded a number of artificia from his stores. He's sprinkled glowstone dust in a circular pattern. Upon the floor he places a small font for a crystal ball.</i>

<i>He places it into position.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> NOW, I KNOW THIS MAY TRY THE LIMITS OF YOUR BELIEF BUT WE ARE PREPARING, HOPEFULLY, TO SPEAK TO ONE OF YOUR ESTRANGED ANCESTORS.

> OR, AT THE VERY LEAST, SOMEONE WHO CALLED THIS PLACE HOME.

### CASSANDRA ###

> OK. YOU'RE THE EXPERT. JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> JUST RELAX AND LET THE EXPERIENCE FILL YOU.

<I>CASSANDRA nods her head.</i>

<i>LARRY speaks, but he doesn't speak in any language CASSANDRA understands. Is it Latin? It's been many years since prep school.</i>

<i>But she follows along in the ritual best she can. Soon, LARRY is lost in his trance. CASSANDRA catches a glimpse of his eyes rolling back into their sockets and it grosses her out.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> O-MÃ‰-SUM-PATRONYM!

<I>And all of a sudden, a reddish image appears.</i>

### CASSANDRA ###

> (thinking) A hologram?

### TEMPERANCE ###

> WHO HAS WOKEN ME FROM MY SLUMBER?!

### LARRY POTTER ###

> IT IS I, THE LOYAL LARRY POTTER, AND THE MODERN RESIDENT...

<I>He turns to CASSANDRA.</I>

> (whispering) Say your name!

### CASSANDRA ###

> UH... CASSANDRA GOTH!

### TEMPERANCE ###

> CASSANDRA... GOTH.

### CASSANDRA ###

> CASSANDRA GOTH!

### TEMPERANCE ###

> ...INDEED.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WE SEND THE SINCEREST OF APOLOGIES FOR DISTURBING YOUR ETERNAL RETIREMENT, ROYAL SLUMBER. BUT...

> SOME OF YOUR FOLLOWERS SEEM TO BE CAUSING ISSUE IN THE MORTAL REALM.

### TEMPERANCE ###

> <U>MY</U> FOLLOWERS?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> UH... THAT WAS OUR IMPRESSION, CORRECT US IF WE ARE MISTAKEN.

### TEMPERANCE ###

> I HAVE NO FOLLOWERS.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> OH. WELL. HM.

### TEMPERANCE ###

> TELL THIS... 'CASSANDRA GOTH' -- THAT I DON'T SPEAK TO THE MEDIA.

> NOW PLEASE. LET ME BE. I WAS BUSYING MYSELF BEFORE YOU SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED ME.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I... WILL... MISS... 

> TEMPERANCE.

<I>The figment disappears. CASSANDRA inquires upon LARRY.</i>

### CASSANDRA ###

> WELL? WHAT DID YOU FIND?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING BUT I DID SPEAK TO SOMEONE.

### CASSANDRA ###

> WHAT DID THEY SAY?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> SHE REQUESTED TO BE CALLED... 'TEMPERANCE'.

> SHE SAID.... UH... WELL. WE MAY HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR COURTSHIP TO GET ANYTHING INTELLIGIBLE.

### CASSANDRA ###

> YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH MY MOTHER?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL... NO. 

> PLAINLY, NO. I WASN'T.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME HELPFUL ADVICE. 

> SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN GRANMAMA AFTER ALL.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO GET JUST THE PERSON YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

> IT'S AS IF YOU'RE WANTING TO CALL SOMEONE BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER PHONE NUMBER.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I SEE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT I'M SURE IF WE KEEP TRYING, EVENTUALLY THEY'LL GIVE US THE RIGHT ADDRESS.

### CASSANDRA ###

> OF COURSE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> DID YOUR MOTHER DIE HERE?

### CASSANDRA ###

> IN THIS HOUSE? NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

> NO, I'M CERTAIN NOT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, THAT MAKES OUR WORK A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BUT CERTAINLY NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I... SEE.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> YOU SAID YOU HAD A ROOMMATE?

### CASSANDRA ###

> YEAH, I DO. SHE'S AT WORK, I GUESS.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, WHEN SHE COMES BACK I'LL NEED TO TALK TO HER, GET HER ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE'S SEEN.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I'M SURE THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

> CAN I... OFFER YOU SOME REFRESHMENT?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> THAT... THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

> CHANNELING WITH THE DENIZENS OF THE AFTERLIFE HAS LEFT ME FAMISHED.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I DON'T HAVE MUCH -- 

> I'M A TERRIBLE COOK AND MY ROOMIE ALWAYS GETS TAKEOUT... BUT... I HAVE SOME OF THIS BOMBASS MAPO TOFU I GOT FROM A PLACE DOWN THE STREET.

> IT'S A LITTLE SPICY BUT IT'S QUITE GOOD ONCE YOU BECOME ACCLIMATED.

> THAT IS, OF COURSE, IF YOU DON'T MIND EATING MY LEFTOVERS. PROMISE THERE'S NO SECOND-HAND -- I ALWAYS SERVE OUT OF THE CONTAINER, NEVER EAT DIRECTLY FROM IT.

> SORRY FOR BEING A LITTLE CHATTY -- IT'S JUST NOT OFTEN THAT I GET COMPANY.

> I GET SO LONELY THESE DAYS.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> IT... IT'S FINE...

> YES. THE MAPO TOFU SOUNDS GREAT. I'D LOVE SOME.

> IF YOU'RE OFFERING.

### CASSANDRA ###

> YES PLEASE! TAKE IT!

> I HAD QUITE A FEAST LAST NIGHT AND I DON'T WANT IT TO GO SOUR.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU.
