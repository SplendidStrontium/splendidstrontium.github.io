### // HUDSON RIVER VALLEY //

<BR><I>All thought melts away in the flight. All worry about my domain. All thought of my son --</i>

<i>No. <U>Not</U> all thought of my son.</i>

<i>My wing motions are frenzied and desperate. I am almost frail in this state. </i>

<i>I must rest.</i>

<i>I only hope I can remember the location.</i>

<br><i>This realm is one of events and consequence. I often find it difficult to grok the ways in which time is woven throughout its threads.</i>

<i>Elysion is not like that. It has neither time nor space and yet it has a myriad of inhabitants. Mostly the Dreamcarvers.</i>

<i>The wolves were someone different.</i>

<i>Everything had changed when I'd fallen in with the Coven. I'd stopped calling on the wolves.</i>

<i>Kevin had happened.</i>

<i>And now he had slipped through my fingers.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>I hadn't seen the wolves since long before my internment. Long ago we'd run in the forests, the Endless Patrol.</i>

<i>But I had become domesticated.</i>

<i>Who is to say they would answer my voice?</i>
