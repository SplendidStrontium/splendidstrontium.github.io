### // THE LABORATORY //

<br><i>On Monday morning, I had a cold. It started in with a thickness to my throat when breathing. But as I rose and started to clamor about the cell, I realized my nose was running.</i>

<i>An irritating running that was more an inconvenience than a sign of true illness.</i>

<i>Autumn came in to deliver my breakfast that morning.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DOCTOR TODAY.

#### AUTUMN

> YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIM UNTIL THIS EVENING. HE'S NOT AT THIS LOCATION AT THIS CURRENT TIME.

#### KEVIN

> I SEE.
> 
> WELL, I HAVE A COLD TODAY.

#### AUTUMN

> YOU HAVE A COLD?
> 
> WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?

#### KEVIN

> MY THROAT IS SCRATCHY AND MY NOSE IS RUNNING.

#### AUTUMN

> PERHAPS YOU'LL ALLOW ME JUST A MOMENT TO GET MY SUPPLIES...
> 
> I'D LIKE TO TAKE A SAMPLE --

<BR><I>I had already made up my mind concerning this matter.</i>

#### KEVIN

> NO! NEVER!!

<BR><I>She softens her posture and comes toward me with gentle hands.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> NOW, KEVIN. 
> 
> DON'T FIGHT, PLEASE.
> 
> WE'RE JUST TRYING TO TREAT YOUR COLD.
> 
> YOU'RE FAR TOO SUSPICIOUS OF US. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO HURT YOU WITH JUST A SIMPLE SAMPLE --

#### KEVIN

> I'LL FIGHT AND KEEP FIGHTING.

#### AUTUMN

> NOW WHY DID YOU BRING IT UP IF YOU WEREN'T WILLING TO SUBMIT TO EVEN A SWABBING?

#### KEVIN

> I WANTED TO SEE THE DOCTOR.

#### AUTUMN

> I TOLD YOU THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE UNTIL LATER TODAY.

#### KEVIN

> YES. I AM AWARE.

<BR><I>She turns to face a desolate wall for a moment, exasperated with her failure.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> THIS ISN'T HOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET YOU BETTER.

<BR><I>I had my back up and was prepared to resist. But she seemed defeated.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T WANT TO GET BETTER.

#### AUTUMN

> WE WANT YOU TO GET BETTER.

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT.

#### AUTUMN

> I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY, KEVIN.

<BR><I>There is no point continuing down this rabbit hole. I stop talking and she soon leaves the room in a cloud of uncertainty.</i>
<br><br>

*****
#### TRELAINE

> DID YOUR FATHER EVER READ TO YOU THE STORY OF DRACULA?

#### KEVIN

> NO, I CAN'T SAY I'M FAMILIAR.

#### TRELAINE

> THEN YOU'RE UNFORTUNATELY NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGEND OF SCHOLOMANCE.
> 
> THAT WAS WHERE HE LEARNED IT: BLOOD MAGIC.
> 
> THE POWER OVER LIFE AND DEATH.

<BR><I>But I did not follow.</i>

<i>He changes the subject.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> THE NURSE WAS TELLING ME THAT YOU WERE ASKING AFTER RECONSTRUCTIVE DENTISTRY.

#### KEVIN

> I WASN'T.
> 
> BUT I DO HAVE A COLD.

#### TRELAINE

> PROBABLY A REACTION TO THE CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT. 
> 
> THE CHANGE IN AIR, IF YOU WILL.

<BR><I>He seemed unwilling, or unable to do anything about my cold.</i>

<i>At least he wasn't offering to swab at my nose.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY TRAINING, YOU KNOW, AS A DOCTOR.
> 
> IT'S A PROFESSION FOR WHICH I'VE ALWAYS HAD IMMENSE FONDNESS.

#### KEVIN

> WHY?

#### TRELAINE

> I WANT TO HELP THE VAMPIRES OF THE WORLD.
> 
> YOUR FAMILY TAUGHT YOU ABOUT THEM, DID THEY NOT?

<BR><I>Yes, I had come across the Vampire in the Monster Manual.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> I WANT TO HELP THEM SEE THE LIGHT.

<BR><I>I pause a moment.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WOULDN'T THAT BE...ANATHEMA TO THEM?

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
> 
> HAVE A DRINK WITH ME, KEVIN.

#### KEVIN

> I'M TWELVE YEARS OLD.

#### TRELAINE

> ALMOST THIRTEEN, IF I'VE HEARD CORRECTLY.

#### KEVIN

> WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

#### TRELAINE

> WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
> 
> I OFFERED YOU A SPOT OF BRANDY BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY NEARLY A MAN AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

#### KEVIN

> YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED YOUR PROJECT WITH ME.

<BR><I>The Doctor Trelaine removes a second glass from the small cupboard and pours a finger of the rosy liquid. He pushes the cup across the table toward me.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> TAKE IT OR DON'T TAKE IT; IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.
> 
> I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR TEETH.
> 
> ONE OF MY AREAS OF CONCENTRATION IS THE FIELD OF DENTISTRY.
> 
> SO MUCH OF WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE RESTS IN OUR TEETH.

<BR><I>I did not want to talk about my teeth.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> THE NURSE SAID SHE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT --

#### KEVIN

> I DO NOT THINK MY TEETH ARE A MINOR BIRTH DEFECT.

<BR><I>He is slightly surprised at my interruption, and allows time for the room to breathe.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> NO...PERHAPS NOT.
> 
> THEY ARE UNUSUAL.
> 
> YOUR MOTHER WAS OF ADVANCED AGE WHEN YOU WERE CREATED. 
> 
> EVEN FOR A SORCERESS.

<BR><I>Did I know Mother's birthyear? I combed through my nascent thoughts.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD YOUR MOTHER WAS WHEN YOU WERE BORN?

<BR><I>I look at him and his eyes flash through shining moisture.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> SHE WAS OVER EIGHTY YEARS OLD.
> 
> TWICE THAT OF A MORTAL'S CHILDBEARING YEARS.

<BR><I>Mother could work magic. Didn't that count for anything?</i>

#### TRELAINE

> IT IS UNUSUAL, ESPECIALLY FOR A MAGE SUCH AS HERSELF YET TO DEVELOP HER AMBROSIA.
> 
> IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE SHE'S NOT YOUR MOTHER AT ALL.

<BR><I>At this, I stood up and pushed the chair out with my straightening legs. I could not sit for such an accusation.</i>

#### KEVIN

> HOW DARE YOU!
> 
> HOW DARE YOU!!

<BR><I>In some sort of defensive posture, he seems to shrug his shoulders.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> I'M SORRY FOR OFFENDING YOU.
> 
> IT WAS IDLE SPECULATION.
> 
> I WASN'T UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU HAD SUCH A STRONG ATTACHMENT TOWARD HER.

#### KEVIN

> I'LL NOT SUFFER --

#### TRELAINE

> I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY; MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES FOR SPEAKING OUT OF LINE REGARDING YOUR FAMILY TREE. I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO SPEAK ON THINGS ON WHICH I HAVE NO AUTHORITY.

<BR><I>I slowly make motion to sit again.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> IT DOES NOT MATTER, OF COURSE.
> 
> I WAS JUST ADMIRING YOUR TEETH AND REMARKING ON THEIR STRANGENESS.
> 
> YOU SEE, ONE OF THE MANY SERVICES I PROVIDE FOR THE VAMPIRES I COUNT AMONGST MY FRIENDS ARE CLEANINGS BUT ALSO REALIGNMENTS.
> 
> I'D LIKE TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR TEETH, KEVIN.
> 
> YOUR SILHOUETTE SEEMS TO BE A SOURCE OF PAIN IN YOUR SELF-REGARD.
> 
> WE CAN IMPROVE THAT. 
> 
> I'VE DONE THE SAME FOR MANY A YOUNG VAMPIRE.

#### KEVIN

> I'M NOT A VAMPIRE.

<BR><I>The Doctor seems to choose carefully the words with which he replies.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> NO, YOU'RE NOT A VAMPIRE.
> 
> BUT YOU HAVE A MOUTH FULL OF RAGGED TEETH.
> 
> HALF-AGAIN MORE THAN YOU NEED TO DEFEAT A ROAST BEEF SANDWICH.
> 
> LET ME SET THEM STRAIGHT AGAIN.
> 
> DO ME THE HONOR OF ALLOWING ME TO WORK ON YOU.

<BR><I>If I'd had a spare moment, I would have run my tongue over the familiar surface of my teeth, feeling each, some sharp, some less, but each anything but a Mortal's chunk of dentin.</i>

<I>I, too, carefully measure my response.</i>

#### KEVIN

> LET ME ASK MY PARENTS.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'RE GETTING A FAIR BIT TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS.
> 
> IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS.

#### KEVIN

> I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

#### TRELAINE

> AND YET, YOU DETEST YOUR APPEARANCE.
> 
> YOU SHUN MIRRORS AND WON'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH IN FRONT OF YOUR WINDOWPANE.

<BR><I>It was certainly true that my cell contained a particularly troublesome mirror over the sink that seemed to cast its reflection over the entire room.</i>

<i>Avoiding the mirror's gaze was easier said than done in that small space.</i>

<i>If Mother had offered to fix my teeth, that would've been one thing. But in captivity? Sedated and poked at like some kind of science experiment?</i>

#### KEVIN

> YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO STEAL THEM.
> 
> MY TEETH.

#### TRELAINE

> THIS IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM MY WORK ON THE GENOME.
> 
> AND IN FACT YOUR TEETH WOULD PROVIDE VERY LITTLE HELP TO US ON THAT FRONT.
> 
> THE TEETH ARE COMPOSED OF THICK DEPOSITS OF MINERAL. 
> 
> THEY'RE NOT EVEN BONE, WHERE BONE IS LACED THROUGHOUT WITH TINY BLOOD VESSELS.
> 
> THE TEETH ARE PURE.

<BR><I>I look back at him. He seems enraptured by his sermon.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'LL WANT YOUR TEETH TO BE FUNCTIONAL, IF -- 
> 
> OR WHEN --

#### KEVIN

> 'WHEN' WHAT?

#### TRELAINE

> YOU AWAKEN AS A VAMPIRE.
> 
> YOUR TIME AS A CHILD WILL DRAW TO A CLOSE AND THE HUNGER WILL SET IN.
> 
> NOT UNLIKE WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED, BUT FAR, FAR MORE VITAL.
> 
> YOUR EVERY FIBER WILL OSCILLATE WITH NEED, WITH DESIRE.
> 
> FOR THE HUNT.

#### KEVIN

> IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE THEN?
> 
> A VAMPIRE?

#### TRELAINE

> AND YOUR FATHER, TOO.
> 
> THOUGH THE NATURE OF HIS CURSE DIFFERENT THAN MINE.
> 
> YOU'LL WANT TEETH THAT FUNCTION, THAT PIERCE THE FLESH NEATLY, AND DO NOT RAVAGE.
> 
> A STRAIGHT LINE OF TEETH WITH A PREDATOR'S CUSPIDS.
> 
> WHETHER OR NOT YOU CHOOSE TO JOIN US, YOUR DAYS OF YOUTH ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE.
> 
> EVEN YOUR FATHER MAY THANK US FOR THE WORK WE HAVE DONE.
> 
> IT SEEMS HE'S POWERLESS TO SET THEM STRAIGHT HIMSELF.

<BR><I>The alcohol was beginning to take effect and I felt dizzy.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MY FATHER IS A POWERFUL MAN.

#### TRELAINE

> YES, CERTAINLY.
> 
> BUT HE'S NO DOCTOR.

<BR>
