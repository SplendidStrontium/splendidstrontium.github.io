### // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<br><i>In the years following my captivity, I had become finally close to my parents. The secret of my father's curse lifted, a barrier eliminated. </i>

<i>The truth of my existence was setting in fits and spurts. Each day the sun moved in the sky, I moved further from the silence that'd kept me locked in a child's fear.</i>

<i>I could not find true rest. I lay in my bed, curtains drawn, mind awash with adrenaline.</i>

<i>Soon, I tried to console myself, these feelings would be beyond me.</i>

<i>I spend a day in isolation until the evening rises.</i>

<i>Cedric is sitting outside in the garden when I find him again.</i>

#### KEVIN

> HEY CEDRIC.

<I>He pauses and wordlessly acknowledges my entrance.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HEY KEV.

#### KEVIN

> HOW IS IT?
> 
> I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE.

#### CEDRIC

> ...I FEEL TERRIBLE.

<I>I wish I had some solace to offer him.</i>

#### KEVIN

> YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE BETTER SOON. 
> 
> IT DOESN'T LAST.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT, UNTIL I FEED FOR THE FIRST TIME?
> 
> SO I'M A RAPIST NOW?

<I>Cedric never minced words.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WE DON'T KILL.

#### CEDRIC

> GREAT.
> 
> WE JUST LURE THE UNSUSPECTING TO BECOME OUR VICTIMS?
> 
> COAX INNOCENTS TO BECOME OUR MINDSLAVES?

#### KEVIN

> ...I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER BUT IT'S OUR CURSE.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?

#### KEVIN

> I...I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

#### CEDRIC

> HAS YOUR FATHER ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS?

#### KEVIN

> FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

#### CEDRIC

> WELL I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME FOR BEING TREPIDATIOUS.
> 
> I GUESS IT'S TRUE; YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH, YOU'LL SEE YOURSELF BECOME THE ENEMY.

#### KEVIN

> THERE ARE WORSE THAN US OUT THERE.

#### CEDRIC

> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

#### KEVIN

> A FEW YEARS BACK, I WAS KIDNAPPED. 
> 
> THEY TRIED TO GET ME TO JOIN THEM.
> 
> THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HUMANITY.
> 
> THEY WOULD BE FINE TO SEE EVERYONE REDUCED TO SLAVES.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?

#### KEVIN

> BECAUSE WE TRY TO RESIST.
> 
> AND WHEN WE FAIL, WE KEEP TRYING.
> 
> THIS WORLD ISN'T OURS TO TAKE.

#### CEDRIC

> ISN'T THAT WHAT VAMPIRISM IS?

#### KEVIN

> IN A WAY.
> 
> BUT WE KEEP TRYING TO RESIST.

<BR><I>Cedric looks toward the flowers, bright in their prime.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I WISH SHE'D LEFT ME FOR DEAD.

<BR><I>There is little I can offer him.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WE CAN'T HELP OUR INITIAL CONDITIONS.
> 
> BUT WE CAN MAKE THE CHOICE TO RISE ABOVE THEM.

#### CEDRIC

> AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RISE ABOVE THIS?

#### KEVIN

> STAY WITH ME AND MY FATHER. 
> 
> LET HIM TRAIN YOU AND TEACH YOU HOW TO BE MORE THAN A MONSTER.

#### CEDRIC

> HOW DO I KNOW HE'S NOT A MONSTER?

#### KEVIN

> YOU DON'T.

<BR>
