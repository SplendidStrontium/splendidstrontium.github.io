## // MYRTLE'S RANCH // ##

<i>When KEVIN reaches the porch, the door has been left ajar. He rustles his keys into his right-hand pocket.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> COME IN, KEV.

<I>KEVIN steps into the modest ranch. Dark colors, ornate paislies predominate the small room. A couch with blue fabric and carved feet sits in the center of the room facing a medium-sized CRT television. A hand-me-down.</i>

<i>KEVIN closes the door behind him. CEDRIC is standing off to one side of the room, to the left of the entrance.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> I'M MAKING TEA. CREAM AND SUGAR?

<i>In KEVIN's mind, the seat of his memory, he hears the authoritative voice of his father.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You're always making tea.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">...</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Neither.</p>
</div>

<i>But it's just a voice.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> JUST... UH. A DASH OF SUGAR.

<I>MYRTLE looks KEVIN in the eyes. She has a sad, quiet look about her. A woman old before her time, unsure what to make of her greying hair.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Fine; milk's probably old anyway.</p>
</div>

<i>The TV is on, albeit quietly. It looks to be some kind of crime television show. A monster-of-the-week mystery wrapped up by the end of the hour. Its flashing is fairly easily ignored.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> SO WHAT BAD NEWS DO YOU BOYS HAVE TO DELIVER TO ME THIS WEEK?

<i>CEDRIC looks at KEVIN, who looks back at CEDRIC. CEDRIC lowers his head and looks at the floor.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> MINERVA HAS PASSED ON.

<i>MYRTLE looks at CEDRIC for a moment, then averts her eyes.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She knew.</p>
</div>

### MYRTLE ###

> IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU WOULD BE COMING IN HERE TO SAY THAT.

> OH - MINERVA. 

> WHY LIKE THIS.

### CEDRIC ###

> MISSUS MARSCAPONE... I'M SO SORRY.

### MYRTLE ###

> OH THERE WAS NOTHING THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

<I>CEDRIC tries not to take the words personally.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> I LOVED HER BUT... WAS SHE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST GAGARIN? THE NSR?

> SHE WAS A WONDERFUL HEALER BUT NOT MUCH OF A POLITICIAN.

> SHE STOOD AGAINST THE EAST IN THE OLD DAYS BUT SHE GOT SO TIRED AFTER RETURNING HOME.

> I ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME...

### KEVIN ###

> HAD SHE FOUND THE SECRET?

### MYRTLE ###

> (ponderously) HAD SHE? 

> I DO NOT KNOW. 

> SHE NEVER TOLD ME.

<I>MYRTLE turns around to shut off the tea water before it whistles. She opens the lid to place a chunk of tea leaves in the pot.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't think so.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'd guess not.</p>
</div>

<i>After a moment, KEVIN tries to break into the conversation.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MOTHER, I...

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Please don't call her that.</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN sits down to feign interest in television. Shortly after, CEDRIC's cellphone buzzes.</i>

### MYRTLE ### 

> (chuckling mournfully) I NEVER DID LIKE WHAT SHE DID WITH HER HAIR.

<i>CEDRIC seems irritated at whatever he reads. He pitter patters a text response back into his phone.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO BEAUTIFUL. THE BRAIDS WERE FINE, BUT WHY THE BLUE? 

> AND SHE NEVER KEPT UP WITH IT SO IT WAS MORE GREEN THAN BLUE.

> I DON'T THINK SHE WAS BLEACHING IT EITHER, SO THE PAINT-ON COLOR NEVER REALLY TOOK.

> NOT THAT I THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE BLEACHED HER HAIR, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO A COLOR, COMMIT TO IT!

<I>CEDRIC looks absently toward MYRTLE and she goes silent.</i>

### CEDRIC ### 

> SORRY ABOUT THAT. 

### MYRTLE ###

> NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

<i>KEVIN had zoned into semi-consciousness staring at the television. His father's voice brings him back.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc?</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> (thinking) Yes, probably.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Wasn't he supposed to be here?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He's particularly fond of your mother.</p>
</div>

<I>MYRTLE pours the tea kettle into a sieve over three teacups. The leftover leaves are knocked over a plate. She runs the mesh underneath the running sink water.</i>

### MYRTLE ### 

> TEA'S DONE BUT IT'S SCALDING HOT.

<I>MYRTLE pushes the ancillary cups toward the men, across her counter, leaving the center cup for herself. She brings it to her mouth and blows on it without sipping.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> (thinking) See, she's listening.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kev-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I miss tea.</p>
</div>

<i>Again MYRTLE blows on the tea, rippling the surface. KEVIN, CEDRIC are allowing theirs to come to room temperature.</i>

<i>KEVIN realizes that MYRTLE has omitted the sugar from his tea, either intentionally or accidentally. But it's not a point worth raising.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> MINERVA WAS A FINE WOMAN.

> AS I AM SURE YOU KNOW, I MET HER IN THE WAR.

> SHE TAUGHT ME A NUMBER OF POULTICES I HAD NEVER IMAGINED BEFORE.

> SOME OF THEM LAUGHABLY SIMPLE, RICE FLOUR, SOURED MANDRAKE... 

> (laughing) WE USED TO ARGUE, I PREFERRED INCANTATIONS, DESPITE MANY OF THE SOLDIERS' PROTESTATIONS ABOUT WITCHERY AND THAT NONSENSE.

<I>MYRTLE laughs again, quietly, reliving simpler times.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> YOU MIGHT THINK A MAN ON HIS DEATH BED WOULD ACCEPT ANY MEDICINE OFFERED, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.

> NO, A NUMBER OF THEM PREFERRED HER STINKING FLOWERS. AS IF THEY WERE ANY LESS MAGICAL. 

> I REMEMBER ONCE, SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER MOTHER.

> TERRIBLE COOK, APPARENTLY. 'MY MOTHER THE TERRIBLE COOK' OR SOME NONSENSE SHE USED TO SPOUT.

> I WAS ALWAYS ENVIOUS BUT I TRIED TO LISTEN BEST I --

### &#119070; east of savannah, from tampa to... &#119135; ###

### - beep - ###

<i>CEDRIC silences the cellphone.</i> 

### CEDRIC ###

> LISTEN, I'M SORRY, I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

<i>CEDRIC leaves the room through the front door.</i>
