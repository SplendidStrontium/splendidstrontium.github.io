<br><i>A few weeks have passed at the OLD GALANTOME ESTATE. Larry has more or less moved in; the fact of the matter being that he was more or less homeless prior; he'd been living out of his car, using the occasional campsite when his business took him out of the five boroughs.</i>

<i>He'd become accustomed to the quiet that such a life created. His life had become habit, thought still marred by jealousy of the place of privledge enjoyed by the MARSCAPONE clan.</i>

<i>Sure, his alumni status meant he was able, permitted, to dine at their leisure from time to time -- pop in for a cookie and a spot of tea under the guise of a book request. He'd hoped his loyalty might someday win him a place near the Crone's chair; many of her other students left the city after graduation -- but KEVIN's miraculous return to health -- not to mention, of course, the Elder's untimely death -- had thrown a serious wrench into his delusions of grandeur.</i>

<i>KEVIN & LARRY were of similar age. But much else about the young MARSCAPONE had remained shrouded in mystery -- poor health had confined the young boy to his bedroom.</i>

<i>The students of the Magicademy had only scant rumor to speak of the sickly heir -- much drowned in the unspoken hope of his eventual demise. One such rumor was that he had been conceived... in the ancient way. That is to say, they had not employed the services of a catalyst. How this was possible, the gossippers had always wondered. Either the Crone was much older than she claimed or her chosen consort was very aged indeed. But none had ever seen the Headmistress tease the existence of a romance. She was, or seemed to be, entirely solitary, sworn to celibacy. And so, in the absence of proof, save the obvious existence of the young boy KEVIN, the rumors floated on the wind as unsolved mysteries.</i>

<i>The Elder MYRTLE MARSCAPONE opened his bedroom door a few times a day to bring him a tray heaping with food, sometimes a new library book. LARRY's enduring memory that of the boy's small salutation:</i>

<i>"Hello, Mother."</i>
<BR><BR>

*****

### // OLD GALANTOME ESTATE // 

<BR><i>The young heiress CASSANDRA GOTH rolls about in bed, sunrise nagging her through the blinds, trickling through the curtains. She had heeded the serious advice of KEVIN and quit her job at FutureSim. But she hadn't yet become accustomed to waking each morning with an empty docket.</i>

<i>It was very much true that she'd been treated much the underling at the laboratory; always the chosen sucker for the odd errand or coffee run. That, she wouldn't miss. But the scars of the manacles still hung heavily, staining her skin, always taut, the recollection of bondage never far from her forethought.</i>

<i>Finally she decides to leave the security of her fluffy, faux-down comforter. She straightens the blankets messily; her father had always preached the gospel of a daily-made bed.</i>

<i>In the mirror is a black-haired woman awash in the bounty of her mid-twenties. Or was she still able to claim "mid"? Numbers' laws had always sat just outside her effortless facility. A subpar SAT score would haunt her long after her apprenticeship at the lab had concluded. </i>

<i>CASSANDRA, now acceptably composed, opens the double-door of the master suite. Collapsed over the table sits a sleeping LARRY POTTER, his unkempt hair just whispering to the crystal ball set in the table's center. CASSANDRA gasps, raising her hands to her mouth.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> LARRY!! MY GOODNESS! ARE YOU OKAY?

<BR><I>She approaches him, fear filling her senses, afraid of the worst. She places her hands gently over his shoulders, desperately hoping to rouse him from slumber.</i>

<i>LARRY emits a few soft groans, uncomfortable in the sleeping position that'd been pressed upon him. For a moment, he's unaware of where he'd been laid.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> LARRY! OH, MY LORD!
> 
> YOU FELL ASLEEP AT THE TABLE!
> 
> ARE YOU OK?!

<BR><I>He stretches, blinks, his eyes crusty with dust.</i>

#### LARRY 

> YEAH... I GUESS I'M OK.

<BR><I>His back aches; he stands and tries to return it to life.</i>

<i>He pushes in the chair in which he'd fainted.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU'RE WORKING TOO HARD, LARRY. REALLY.
> 
> I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THOSE CREEPY DOLLS IN AT LEAST A WEEK. PROBABLY MORE. LONGER.
> 
> I DON'T WANT TO COME OUT HERE AND FIND YOU COLLAPSED LIKE THAT. IT REALLY WORRIES ME!

#### LARRY 

> YEAH...
> 
> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, CASSY. I WAS JUST...
> 
> I DON'T KNOW. COULDN'T SLEEP -- WELL --
> 
> [pause]
> 
> I GUESS I DID EVENTUALLY SLEEP. I WAS JUST... I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING PROGRESS.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU <U>ARE</U> MAKING PROGRESS! PLEASE DON'T WEAR YOURSELF SO THIN!

#### LARRY 

> HEH.
> 
> NO WORRIES THERE.

<BR><I>LARRY chooses the path of the self-deprecating joke; his lifestyle had afforded few trips to the gym and the corners of his metallic steed had become peppered with junk food wrappers.</i>

<i>LARRY manages a smile, weakly. He is glad that it was CASSANDRA who'd found him and not... LUCIA.</I>

<I>He looks over his shoulder toward her room. The door is closed and quiet.</i>

#### LARRY 

> WHAT TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

#### CASSANDRA 

> FEW MINUTES TO SEVEN.

<BR><I>LARRY continues to stretch. He'd come to find comfort in his car's backseat, but that rickety chair was not a familiar pose for him.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> LET ME COOK YOU SOME BREAKFAST.

#### LARRY 

> [stretching, unintelligible noise]

#### CASSANDRA 

> THAT IS, UNLESS YOU'D PREFER TO GO BACK TO SLEEP. I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU GOT GREAT REST HUNCHED OVER THE TABLE...

<BR><I>The suggestion implies a return to his assigned room.</i>

#### LARRY 

> [resisting, with energy] OH, NO; I'M AWAKE NOW.
> 
> [pause]
> 
> I'D LOVE SOME BREAKFAST.

<BR><i>A smile breaks upon CASSANDRA's face. It was always more fun to cook for two.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> GREAT! BOILED EGGS 'N' TOAST?

#### LARRY 

> SOUNDS GREAT.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SOFT OR HARD? 'BOILED, THAT IS...
> 
> [blushing slightly]

#### LARRY 

> SOFT, SOFT.
> 
> I HATE IT WHEN THE INSIDES OF THE EGG TURN ALL GREY-LIKE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> OH, YEAH. THAT MEANS THEY'RE OVERDONE.

#### LARRY 

> IT'S HARD... TO KNOW...

#### CASSANDRA 

> [interj.] JUST WHEN TO TAKE THEM OUT.

<BR><I>They chuckle, lightly, in time. The pause sees them just catch each other's gaze. Words fall from the tools available to them.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> ...DOWNSTAIRS, THEN.

<BR><I>They track down the staircase. Each is aware that they prepare to dine in the absence of the witch of the house. But she kept her own schedule, appearing at unpredictable times and for awkward durations. LARRY feels a guilt from an unknown source and tries to follow her into the kitchen. But she refuses him entrance.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> SIT-SIT!
> 
> YOU'RE THE ONE WHO FELL ASLEEP IN A CHAIR.

<BR><I>LARRY cannot debate the point. He sits at the nearby dining table.</i>

#### LARRY 

> FINE-FINE. CAN DO.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA removes a carton of eggs from the 'fridge. The loaf of bread is retreived from its rest upon the top of the icebox. The rubber feet of the toaster squeak against the stress of CASSANDRA pulling it from its sleep adjacent to the tile moulding. The counter is just sprinkled with bread crumb detritus.</i>

#### LARRY 

> THANKS FOR COOKING FOR ME, CASSY.

#### CASSANDRA 

> OH, IT'S NO-THING. I LIKE IT, REALLY.
> 
> [removes a medium-sized pot from a lazy susan]

<BR><i>She turns to the sink and the sloshing of tap water necessitates a moment of silence. But soon, it is over.</i>
<BR><BR>
<center>[ CLIK CLIK CLIK.... ]</center><BR>

<i>And the gas range whistles to life. CASSANDRA sets the water to heat. The emission of gas forms a sort of white noise of ambiance in the background.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA stares at the pot for a little while.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> SO HOW'S THE EXORCISM GOING ELSEWISE? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN TEMPERANCE AGAIN, HAVE YOU?

<BR><I>LARRY becomes anxious at the mention of the name.</i>

#### LARRY 

> OH, YOU SHOULDN'T ASK SUCH THINGS.
> 
> UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE <U>DO</U> SEE HER AGAIN, SHE'LL BE ABLE TO SMELL THE GOSSIP WE CONDUCTED IN HER NAME.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SMELL? GHOSTS CAN SMELL?

#### LARRY 

> SURE CAN.
> 
> ALTHOUGH, IT'S NOT EXACTLY SMELLING AS WE DO. IT'S A PSYCHIC FEELING THAT IS LIKE SMELLING AND HEARING.
> 
> [pause]
> 
> BUT I GUESS IT'S LIKE FEELING, TOO, THE WAY YOU CAN FEEL THE WAVES LAPPING AGAINST YOUR LEGS AT THE BEACH.

#### CASSANDRA 

> OK. SO NO GOSSIP.

#### LARRY 

> NOPE. YOU GOT IT.
> 
> BUT I DO FEEL I'M MAKING GENERAL PROGRESS ON YOUR CASE. IT'S A TRYING ONE FOR SURE.
> 
> YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS DEEPLY CONNECTED TO THIS LOCATION.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS DELUSION ONCE OR TWICE...
> 
> [halts speech, tuts a dismissal]
> 
> NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M A LOONY.

#### LARRY 

> I AM A WORKER IN THE PARANATURAL, REMEMBER?

#### CASSANDRA 

> YEAH... I GUESS.
> 
> EH. WELL. HERE GOES.
> 
> WHAT IF THE HOUSE WERE SENTIENT? COULD THE HOUSE ITSELF BE A SINGLE SENTIENT ENTITY? CAPABLE OF THOUGHT AND FEELING?
> 
> I JUST... WELL... YOU KNOW.
> 
> A BACTERIUM IS SUCH A THING -- ERR. NOT CAPABLE OF THOUGHT SO MUCH, I THINK, BUT IT IS AN ENTITY.
> 
> AND A BACTERIUM CAN INHABIT A HUMAN BODY. AND A HUMAN BODY IS CAPABLE OF ALL THESE THINGS, THOUGHT, FEELING, EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW.
> 
> BUT A BACTERIUM WOULD HAVE NO WAY TO FULLY COMPREHEND THE BODY OF THE HUMAN IN WHICH IT LIVES. SO BY THAT IDEA, COULD NOT A HUMAN BEING LIVING IN A HOUSE BE LIKE A BACTERIUM WHO'S TAKEN UP RESIDENCE INSIDE A HUMAN BEING?

#### LARRY 

> THAT DOESN'T SOUND CRAZY AT ALL TO ME.
> 
> IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE REASONABLE IN MY LINE OF WORK. SPIRITS OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES BOUND TO AN OBJECT, A PLACE, A HOUSE, EVEN.
> 
> JUST AS YOU AND I ARE SOULS BOUND TO THESE CORPOREAL MEATBAGS.
> 
> AT LEAST, THAT IS OUR CURRENT STATE. SOMEDAY THAT WILL... CHANGE.
> 
> [shivers, as if cold wind assails his person]
> 
> WHEN WE DO SEE GHOSTS, THEY ARE OFTEN TAKING THEIR SHADOW-FORM SO AS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THEM. BUT THEY DON'T REST LIKE THAT, THINK LIKE THAT...

<BR><I>CASSANDRA removes pre-sliced bread from a porous plastic sleeve and slips it into the aforementioned toaster. It disappears with a distinct</i>
<BR><BR>
<center>[ SWINK! ]</center><BR>

<i>The toaster buzzes just audibly, heating its inner coils. CASSANDRA turns and revisits the refridgerator, removing a tub of spreading butter. She walks over to the dining table and places it inoffensively within his reach.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE, WITH ALL OUR DRAMAS AND DREAMS, THAT WE COULD BE REGARDED AS NO MORE COMPLEX THAN MICRO-ORGANISMS.

#### LARRY 

> THANKFULLY THE SOULS OF THE DEAD TEND TO HAVE PITY AND INTEREST IN US, HAVING THEMSELVES ONCE OCCUPIED THE PRIME MATERIAL PLANE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> BUT THEY COULD ALWAYS CHANGE THEIR MINDS. 
> 
> I TAKE ANTI-BIOTICS WHEN I FEEL UNWELL.

#### LARRY 

> IT'S TRUE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> THOUGH I TRY NOT TO. IT WIPES OUT GOOD BACTERIA AS MUCH AS IT DOES BAD.
> 
> SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY NEED THE FLUSH.

#### LARRY 

> YOU'RE SPEAKING OF THE HIGHER-ORDER SPIRITS. I CAN'T SAY I HAVE MUCH SWAY WITH THEM. 
> 
> IT'S HARD TO ... GET... AN INTELLIGIBLE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.
> 
> NOT JUST IS THE LANGUAGE AND TIMEKEEPERS AN ISSUE, BUT MATTERS OF SCALE...

#### CASSANDRA 

> LIKE TRYING TO TALK TO YOUR CPU USING A ROTARY PHONE?

<BR><I>The conversation hangs. It is clear LARRY has missed understanding.</i>

#### LARRY 

> UH... "CPU"?

#### CASSANDRA 

> YEAH, YOU KNOW, INSIDE A COMPUTER IS A CPU. IT'S LIKE... THE BRAIN OF THE COMPUTER.
> 
> "CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT" OR SOMESUCH.
> 
> IT PERFORMS ALL THE COMPUTATIONS REQUIRED FOR A COMPUTER TO DO WHAT IT DOES. YOU WANNA LOOK AT A PICTURE OF A KITTY-CAT, IT TELLS YOUR MONITOR WHICH PIXELS TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO RENDER THE DESIRED DATAFILE.

#### LARRY 

> I... UH... SEE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> IT'S INSEPERABLE FROM RAM THOUGH.
> 
> "RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY" --
> 
> BASICALLY HOW MUCH STUFF THE COMPUTER CAN HANDLE IN ITS WORKING THOUGHT.
> 
> YOU KNOW -- CAN YOU PAT YOUR HEAD AND RUB YOUR STOMACH AT THE SAME TIME. THAT OLD JOKE TEST THEY USED TO GIVE YOU IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

#### LARRY 

> CAN... YOU...

#### CASSANDRA 

> PAT YOUR HEAD AND RUB YOUR TUMMY AT THE SAME TIME.
> 
> TRY IT!

<BR><I>LARRY tries. He places his right hand upon his head and his left just in front of his hoodie's pocket. It is a success.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> OK. NOW. SUPER-CHALLENGE.
> 
> CAN YOU STILL DO IT IF YOU SWITCH YOUR HANDS?

#### LARRY 

> LEFT-TO-RIGHT?

#### CASSANDRA 

> YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED, RIGHT?

#### LARRY 

> HEH. YEAH.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SWITCH 'EM AND SEE IF YOU STILL CAN.

<BR><I>He can't.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> AW. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. YOU CAN ALWAYS PRACTICE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE TASK.

<BR><I>LARRY looks at his hands in disappointment.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER SILLY TEST I'VE HEARD OF?

<BR><I>LARRY is silent.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> THAT IF YOU CAN TIE A KNOT IN A CHERRY STEM, YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY A GOOD KISSER. IT'S A BAR TRICK.
> 
> OR, AT LEAST, SOME TRICK YOU'D TRY TO SHOW OFF WHILE AT THE BAR.
> 
> I'M NOT EVEN SO SURE IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE THOUGH. I'VE TRIED A FEW TIMES AND IT HASN'T BEEN EVEN CLOSE.
> 
> I'D HATE TO THINK SUCH A DISABILITY SHOULD CONFINE ME TO THE WORLD OF BAD KISSERS. YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT ONE?

<BR><I>LARRY has been shifting about uncomfortably. He jumps in his seat when</i>
<BR><BR>
<center>[ FLIST! ]</center><BR>

<i>The toast springs forth from the slots.</i>

#### LARRY 

> NO... I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THAT ONE...

<BR><I>She flips the heated bread upon a plate with haste; it's hot.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> [presenting] YOUR TOAST.
> 
> EH. I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE COOKED IT SO SOON; WE'VE STILL GOT TIME ON THE EGGS.

#### LARRY 

> IT'S FINE.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA leaves the table. The water is just threatening to boil.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> TWO 'R THREE?

#### LARRY 

> [with pause] ...THREE...?

#### CASSANDRA 

> ALRIGHT. I'LL TAKE THREE MYSELF. I'M HUNGRY THIS MORNING.

<BR>
<center>[ PLUNCK. PLUNCK. PLUNCK... ]</center><BR>

<i>The six eggs fill the saucepot, seeming small. The water ceases its boil. It will have to equilibriate.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA comes to the table and sits in a seat ninety degrees from LARRY. He seems disquieted.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> [diplomatically, kind] YOU... UH... WANNA BUTTER YOUR TOAST?
> 
> THIS IS THE REAL STUFF. IT'LL MELT BEST IF YOU --

#### LARRY 

> [interj.] YEAH... SURE.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA gets up from the table to fetch him a butter knife. It is broad and just barely aquiline. LARRY takes it from her hand and spreads butter over the wheat toast. It melts almost immediately, becoming translucent.</i>

<i>LARRY takes one bite, instinctually, but regrets his decision and leaves the rest to be consumed with the eggs.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> SO YOU SAID THE SPIRITS BIND THEMSELVES TO OBJECTS IN ORDER TO EXISTS IN THIS SPHERE?

#### LARRY 

> THEY DO. YOU AND I ARE POSSESSED RIGHT NOW, OUR SOULS FEEDING UPON THE EXPERIENCES FACILITATED BY OUR BODIES.

#### CASSANDRA 

> BUT, NOT THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE?

#### LARRY 

> NOW, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
> 
> JUST THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COMMUNE -- ERR -- SPEAK -- WITH HER.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YEAH, I ALWAYS THINK IT'S A "HER", TOO.

#### LARRY 

> OH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN. IT WAS JUST A TURN OF PHRASE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> "TURN OF PHRASE"?

#### LARRY 

> UH, YOU KNOW. AN IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SO IT COULD BE A GIRL <U>OR</U> A BOY.

#### LARRY 

> I... UH. 
> 
> SPIRITS ABLE TO POSSESS AN OBJECT AS STORIED AND COMPLEX AS AN ENTIRE HOUSE MAY BE BEYOND SUCH NOTIONS AS SEXUAL DIMORPHISM.

#### CASSANDRA 

> OH.
> 
> [disappointed] I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

#### LARRY 

> THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE NEED FOR SUCH DISTINCTIONS. SINCE THEY ARE SOURCED FROM OUR REALM.

#### CASSANDRA 

> HUH. I GUESS. BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE WE WERE SOURCED FROM THEIRS, PERHAPS.

#### LARRY 

> IT... UH... MAY DEPEND ON THE SPIRIT THEMSELVES.
> 
> BUT REALLY, I WOULDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF WITH THESE MINOR DETAILS. IT'S KEY WE STAY FOCUSED ON THE HERE AND NOW; THE PRESENT.
> 
> THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EVER HOPE TO GET YOUR HOME'S UNREST SETTLED.

#### CASSANDRA 

> I'M SORRY. I DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERTHINK THINGS.

<BR><I>The table sits in silence for a few moments. CASSANDRA is using the digital clock on the oven to time her eggs.</i>

<i>Neither of them can easily tolerate the broken conversation.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> SO... [pause]
> 
> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT VAMPIRES?

<BR><I>LARRY raises his gaze from his plate and his uneasy expression startles her.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> SHIT! I DIDN'T OFFER YOU ANYTHING TO DRINK.
> 
> COFFEE?

<BR><I>LARRY feels his head is leaden. He takes a moment to reply.</i>

#### LARRY 

> YEAH. SOME COFFEE WOULD BE GREAT.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA is finally able to leave the table and she does so gladly. She has purchased a machine that makes single cups of coffee and it is one of her favorite kitchen gadgets.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> FRENCH VANILLA?

#### LARRY 

> [tired, unenthusiastic] SOUNDS GREAT.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA buzzes about the kitchen. The eggs still need more time.</i>

#### LARRY 

> VAMPIRES ARE UNDEAD. THEIR VERY EXISTENCE IS AN AFFRONT TO GOD.

#### CASSANDRA 

> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE CHRISTIAN.

#### LARRY 

> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I BELIEVE IN THE DIVINITY OF A MAN NAMED JESUS CHRIST -- PROPHET, SON, HOLY MAN, OR OTHER.
> 
> THE UNDEAD KEEP SPIRIT FROM LEAVING THE PLANE. THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
> 
> THEY POSSESS THEIR BODIES BEYOND THEIR PROPERLY ALLOTTED DATE. LIKE A CAR PARKED IN A TWO-HOUR ZONE LOADED UP WITH PARKING TICKETS THAT THE CITY CAN'T TOW BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO SOMEONE FAMOUS.
> 
> AND YOU DESPERATELY WANT THAT PARKING SPACE -- YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT FOR HOURS, DAYS... WEEKS.

#### CASSANDRA 

> THE SOULS ARE BOUND BEYOND THE LAW? HOW CAN THEY DO THAT?
> 
> AND HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT --

#### LARRY 

> THE BODIES, TOO, SHOULD RETURN TO EARTH. THEY ARE THIEVES OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE.
> 
> STEALING LIFE FORCE FROM THOSE THAT CREATE IT WITHOUT ASKING. VAGRANTS. FREELOADERS.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YEAH THE BLOOD-DRINKING IS KIND OF SCARY. I'LL AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

#### LARRY 

> YOU SHOULD AGREE WITH ME EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE MONSTERS.

#### CASSANDRA 

> BUT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE TO CURE IT?

#### LARRY 

> ONCE A THIEF, ALWAYS A THIEF.
> 
> THE BEST HOPE YOU HAVE IS TO BE A THIEF-IN-RECOVERY.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SUGAR, MILK?

#### LARRY 

> ALWAYS. THANKS.

<BR><I>Jealousy can be invigorating. LARRY speaks with renewed energy.</i>

#### LARRY 

> I'M SURE YOU SPEAK OF KEVIN MARSCAPONE.

<BR><I>A flush spreads across CASSANDRA's cheeks.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH --

#### LARRY 

> [interj.] THAT FAMILY? 
> 
> YEAH, I AM.
> 
> I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR... HEIR.

#### CASSANDRA 

> [defensive, disarming] OH, PLEASE, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

#### LARRY 

> I KNOW HE CLAIMS HIMSELF CURED. "CLEANSED".
> 
> I GUESS HE SPREAD THAT FALSE GOSPEL TO YOU TOO.

#### CASSANDRA 

> WE WERE COWORKERS AT MY OLD LAB. AND WHEN LUCIA SHOWED UP ON MY DOORSTEP, SHE NAME-DROPPED KEVIN'S MOTHER.

#### LARRY 

> SHE WOULD. THE CRONE WAS A PROTECTOR. A HOLY WOMAN. 
> 
> TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW.
> 
> AND WHAT TEARS HAS THE PARASITE SHED SINCE HER PASSAGE?
> 
> THE WORLD NEEDED THE HEADMISTRESS. SHE TOOK IN EVERY STRAY SHE FOUND. SHE WALKED IN THE LIGHT. MANY OF OUR KIND HAVE GONE ON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
> 
> SHE COULD HAVE GONE ON TO FOSTER MANY MORE IF SHE HADN'T BEEN BEDRAGGLED BY THE ACCURSED.

#### CASSANDRA 

> THE "ACCURSED"?

#### LARRY 

> THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT HIM. HE NOW STANDS AS THE HOUSE'S CONJURER, BUT...
> 
> IT'S AN AFFRONT TO NATURE.
> 
> AN AFFRONT TO WIZARDS.
> 
> HE WASN'T CONVERTED. HE WASN'T ALWAYS "THAT WAY"; A BORN VAMPIRE.
> 
> THE FACT THAT SOME HIGHER ORDER OF EVIL DARES TO CHANGE THE PROPOGATION METHOD OF THE CURSE...

<br><I>CASSANDRA thinks back to the image presented her by her brother's snooping on the Internet. A young KEVIN, younger than her own brother then, pale and sickly, baring a mouth of mis-matched teeth, oversized and set askew.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> IF HE WERE BORN THAT WAY, IT SEEMS UNFAIR TO DESP --

#### LARRY 

> [interj.] DON'T TRY TO TELL ME WHAT'S FAIR AND UNFAIR!

<br><I>His sudden outburst startles CASSANDRA and he regrets his tone.</i>

#### LARRY 

> [calm] I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST... I HAVE PLENTY OF PERSONAL REASONS TO HATE HIM AS AN ALUM OF HIS MOTHER'S SCHOOL.
> 
> IT JUST COMPOUNDS WHEN I CONSIDER THAT --
> 
> WHILE I MAY PITY THE CHILD, I HAVE NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR THE SOUL -- LIKELY A FULLY-FORMED LANTERN -- THAT CHOSE TO INFEST HIS BODY AND INVADE OUR HOME REALM.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU THINK HIS SPIRIT... WASN'T CREATED ANEW?

#### LARRY 

> NO, I DO NOT. I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT THAT HE IS HOST TO SOMETHING, SOMEONE, FAR OLDER AND WITH SINISTER MOTIVE.

<br><I>The accustation refuses to imbed itself in CASSANDRA's belief system. The eyes she'd seen in the photograph so quiet, sad, lonely...</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> [quietly] "HATE THE SIN; LOVE THE SINNER".

<br><i>CASSANDRA presents LARRY with a piping cup of coffee and three eggs in a bowl.</i>

#### LARRY 

> "LOVE THE..."

#### CASSANDRA 

> [sitting] "HATE THE SIN; LOVE THE SINNER". 
> 
> IT PROBABLY ISN'T AN OFFICIAL PSALM OR ANYTHING, JUST SOMETHING MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.
> 
> IT MEANS YOU CAN HATE THE BAD THINGS PEOPLE DO BUT IT'S NOT YOUR JOB, IT'S EVEN, CRUEL AND UNGODLY, TO HATE A PERSON DIRECTLY.

#### LARRY 

> [scoffs] IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES...
> 
> WATCHING THE MATRON OF MY HOUSE DOTING OVER HIM, REDUCED TO PLAYING NURSEMAID TO EVIL INCARNATE...
> 
> KINDNESS UPON KINDNESS HEAPED UPON THE HUNGERS OF A HELLSPAWN... ONLY TO HAVE THAT VERY CREATURE CLAIM HE'S DISPATCHED WITH HIS CURSE AND STEAL FROM YOU ANY HOPE OF PROMOTION FROM PAPERBOY...

#### CASSANDRA 

> MAYBE IT'S THAT HE'S TRYING TO ATONE FOR HIS SINS.

<br><I>LARRY seems to tense up, losing patience with the discussion. But he tries to disperse the anger. He is, after all, trying to court the GOTH mistress, ghosts and all.</i>

#### LARRY 

> [carefully] YEAH.
> 
> [slowly] I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

#### CASSANDRA 

> SO YOU WENT TO THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC?

#### LARRY 

> SURELY DID. IT WASN'T JUST A SCHOOL, JUST ANY OLD SCHOOL THOUGH.
> 
> IT WAS ALSO... UH... WHAT DO YOU CALL IT... A GROUP HOME.

#### CASSANDRA 

> YOU'RE AN ORPHAN?

#### LARRY 

> I AM. 
> 
> MY PARENTS DIED IN A CAR CRASH.

#### CASSANDRA 

> OH MY GOODNESS. THAT'S TERRIBLE.
> 
> I...
> 
> I'M SORT OF AN ORPHAN, TOO.
> 
> BUT MY PARENTS JUST PASSED A FEW YEARS BACK SO IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD TO GO TO A ... [pause]

#### LARRY 

> A GROUP HOME?
> 
> I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.
> 
> AS FOR ME, IT'S OKAY. I LOVED MY TIME THERE. THE HEADMISTRESS WAS THE FINEST INSTRUCTOR IN ALL AMERRKA. MAYBE EVEN THE WORLD BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT ON AUTHORITY. NEVER LEFT THE STATES MYSELF.
> 
> BUT I'D VENTURE TO BET... 
> 
> [non-seq.] YOU MET THE MATRON, RIGHT?

#### CASSANDRA 

> I... DID.

<br><I>CASSANDRA recalls, just seeming a few months prior, although on recollection it had to be more than that... the MATRON MARSCAPONE had employed ice magicks to threaten and interrogate the young LUCIA EKSTROM.</i>

#### LARRY

> SHE FOUGHT IN THE GREAT WAR AND THEN RETURNED HOME TO FOUND OUR DEAR OLD SCHOOL.

#### CASSANDRA 

> LUCIA CLAIMED MY MOTHER WAS A WITCH. WAS SHE TRAINED BY...

#### LARRY 

> OH, NO. 
> 
> I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOUR MOTHER BUT SHE WAS PROBABLY TAUGHT BY YOUR GRANDMOTHER. MOST MAGICKING FAMILIES ARE LIKE THAT.
> 
> OUR SCHOOL WAS SPECIAL BECAUSE THE HEADMISTRESS TOOK IN ORPHANS, HOUSED US, FED US, TAUGHT US. 
> 
> NOT EVERYONE HAS A FAMILY. BUT SHE FELT,

> IF I MAY BE SO BOLD,

> THAT WE ARE STRONGER WITH NURTURING EVEN THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A MAGICAL HEARTH TO RETURN TO.
> 
> SHE, HERSELF, NEVER KNEW HER MOTHER.
> 
> IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE WASN'T BLESSED WITH A DAUGHTER.

#### CASSANDRA 

> THE USE OF MAGIC GOES DOWN THROUGH THE MATRILINEAL LINE?

#### LARRY 

> IT IS MORE STRONGLY PASSED BY MOTHER TO DAUGHTER, YES, BUT IT'S NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED.
> 
> I, OBVIOUSLY, MARK AN EXCEPTION, AS DOES THE HEADMISTRESS'S SON.

#### CASSANDRA 

> AND ME, TOO. MY MOTHER DIDN'T PASS ANYTHING TO ME.

> I'M JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL IN AN EXTRAORDINARY WORLD.

#### LARRY

> ONE TIME I WAS TALKING WITH KEVIN AND HE MADE IT SOUND LIKE THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE FOR ME...
> 
> A HOPE.
> 
> THAT MAYBE WITH SOME TRAINING MAYBE I COULD...
> 
> BE LIKE YOU.

#### LARRY 

> IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT IS A BIT CRUEL OF HIM TO PLANT THAT HOPE IN YOUR MIND.

#### CASSANDRA 

> A VAMPIRE?

<br><I>LARRY shudders, uncomfortable with the turn of conversation.</i>

#### LARRY 

> SOMETHING LIKE IT. SOME KIND OF STRANGE HALF-BREED.

#### CASSANDRA 

> DOES THAT MEAN HIS FATHER...

#### LARRY 

> [interj.] I DON'T REALLY KNOW!

#### CASSANDRA 

> OK. OK. I'M SORRY.

> [pause]

> ARE VAMPIRES A SUBSET OF MAGES?

#### LARRY 

> WHAT?!

#### CASSANDRA 

> IT'S PROBABLY --

> [quiet] A STUPID QUESTION...
> 
> IT JUST SEEMS LIKE...

#### LARRY 

> YOU'RE ONLY ASKING THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE ONLY JUST RECENTLY LEFT THE MORTAL FOG OF IGNORANCE.

<br><I>Offended, CASSANDRA puts down her utensil.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> IT'S NOT MY FAULT MY MOTHER LIED TO ME!

> AND WOULDN'T YOU BE JUST AS STUPID AS ME IF YOU HADN'T BEEN RECRUITED TO YOUR FANCY LITTLE "MAGICADEMY"!

<br><I>LARRY joins the list of the offended.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> YOU'VE HAD YOUR ENTIRE LIFE WHERE THE REST OF US HAVE WALKED ABOUT STUPIDLY, A VEIL DRAWN OVER OUR EYES!

<BR><I>The room is stunned into silence soon interrupted by the sound of LUCIA descending the stairs.</i>

#### LUCIA 

> OH, CASSY. 
> 
> HAS THE LITTLE WART UPSET YOU?

<BR><I>She walks over to the table.</i>

#### LUCIA

> SHE'S EVEN MADE YOUR BREAKFAST.
