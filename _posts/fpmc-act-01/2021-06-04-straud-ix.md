<i>AVAELLE EASTON, lost, wandered about the island. Her memory scrambled. No one seems to bother her or pay her any mind. It's as if she doesn't exist.</i>

<i>She wanders, listlessly, hungering little. She boards bus after bus and never pays fare. At some point, she finally makes it out east.</i>

<i>AVAELLE knocks on the door of the MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME; a place she's never been before, but seems familiar somehow. If she were more present in the moment, she may suspect deja vu, but today it doesn't come to mind.</i>

<i>KEVIN MARSCAPONE looks out the side window, leaning forward to glean the contents of the porch.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> SHIT. IT'S THE COPY-CAT.

### VINCENT ###

> NO. 

> REALLY?

### KEVIN ###

> AVAELLE EASTON. THE BLACK 'N' WHITE COPY.

### VINCENT ###

> THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE PET.

### KEVIN ###

> HOW DA FUCK DOES SHE KNOW WHERE I LIVE?

> ...

> THIS ISN'T ONE OF YOUR...

### VINCENT ###

> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

### KEVIN ###

> LIAR.

### VINCENT ###

> [smiles mischieviously]

> ANSWER THE DOOR.

### KEVIN ###

> WHY SHOULD I?

### VINCENT ###

> BECAUSE YOU HAVE SYMPATHY. 

> BECAUSE IT MATTERS NOT HOW SHE WAS CREATED BUT THAT SHE WAS CREATED.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE CAN'T EVEN WORK THE TALENT.

### VINCENT ###

> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

> YES, IT IS CERTAINLY LIKELY THAT SHE LACKS THE ABILITY.

> THE DOCTOR IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE A LOSSLESS DATA TRANSFER METHOD.

### KEVIN ###

> I'M DISGUSTED BY HIS ARROGANCE.

### VINCENT ###

> AS AM I, BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SHOW MERCY OUR ENEMY DENIES US.

### KEVIN ###

> IS ALL NOT "FAIR ..."?

### VINCENT ###

> SHE'S ALL THAT'S LEFT OF HIS... BREEDING PROGRAM.

### KEVIN ###

> YOU'D THINK HE'D KNOWN THAT CROSSING PEAS WITH PEAS ISN'T THE METHOD TO BREED A MELON.

### VINCENT ###

> IT'S A WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEIR CLOCK WILL NEVER TOLL. 

> THEY'LL TRY ANYTHING ONCE, TWICE...

> THE URGENCY TO GET SOMETHING CORRECT BEFORE THE TEACHER'S BUZZER ERUPTS JUST ISN'T THERE.

### KEVIN ###

> BUT ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THERE IS A TIME FOR THE DOCTOR'S PROJECT?

### VINCENT ###

> CEDRIC'S ASSERTION OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE DAX? 

> I FEAR IT TOO, BUT WE HAVE NO WAY AS OF YET TO KNOW IF THAT'S PROPHECY OR PIPEDREAM.

<I>AVAELLE continues to knock on the door.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> THANKS A LOT, "DAD".

> NOW I HAVE TO CALL STRAUD.

### VINCENT ###

> AW COME NOW. WE DON'T NEED TO INVOLVE THE OLD MAN.

### KEVIN ###

> EASTON IS HIS. I AIN'T GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT.

### VINCENT ###

> THAT WAS AGES AGO.

<I>AVAELLE continues to bang on the door. Heavy clouds threaten rainfall.</i>

### AVAELLE ###

> MARSCAPONE MUZZLES AND MUTTS?

> HELLO?

> ARE YOU OPEN?

### VINCENT ###

> THEY ALWAYS GET THE NAME WRONG. 

> WHY IS THAT?

### KEVIN ###

> I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO LET HER IN.

> THAT IS WHY YOU LED HER HERE, IS IT NOT?

### VINCENT ###

> SHE'S LOST AND CONFUSED. I'M BLAMING THE DOCTOR FOR THIS ONE.

> PROBABLY TAMPERED WITH HER MEDICATIONS.

> THE WORKING MEMORY OF HIS COPIES JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.

> I'M GLAD WE GOT THE ORIGINAL.

### KEVIN ###

> AVAEL...

> I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL HER ORIGINAL.

### VINCENT ###

> PUT ENOUGH MONKEYS IN A ROOM;

> YOU'LL EVENTUALLY GET...

### KEVIN ###

> I THOUGHT WE JUST AGREED THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

### VINCENT ###

> YES, IN FACT WE DID.

> BUT WHAT I SAID IS THAT YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE A MELON FROM TWO PEAS.

> BUT TWO WILD PEAS, EVEN YEAR AFTER YEAR OF POOR YIELD, MAY FINALLY MUTATE IN A WAY BENEFICIENT TO MANKIND.

> I SUPPOSE YOU COULD FOLLOW UP THAT UNDER THAT LOGIC, YOU COULD PRESUMABLY GET A MELON FROM A PEA.

> BUT THE REALM OF NUMBERS IS RARELY SO KIND TO US.

### KEVIN ###

> MHM.

### VINCENT ###

> DON'T TELL THEM I SAID THAT, THOUGH.

> THEY'RE KEEN TO HOLD A GRUDGE.

> AGAIN.

<I>AVAELLE continues to bang upon the door.</i>

<i>KEVIN finally answers the call.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MY SINCEREST OF APOLOGIES, MADAME.

> THIS IS, INDEED, THE OFFICE OF...

> "MARSCAPONE MUZZLES AND MUTTS"...

### VINCENT ###

> [snickers]

### KEVIN ###

> BUT WE USUALLY DON'T OPEN UP SHOP UNTIL EIGHT.

> AS YOU CAN SEE...

<i>KEVIN pulls out a leather-bound wrist-watch and shows her the time.</i>

> IT IS JUST PAST SEVEN-THIRTY.

<I>AVAELLE is stunned, embarrassed.</i>

### AVAELLE ###

> OH MY, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

> YOUR BUSINESS CARD DIDN'T LIST OPERATING HOURS SO ...

> I ASSUMED YOU WERE OPEN TWENTY-FOUR-SEVEN.

### KEVIN ###

> "BUSINESS CARD"?

<I>VINCENT seems to whistle, stroll about, looking toward the sky.</i>

### AVAELLE ###

> YES, I HAVE A COPY OF IT RIGHT HERE...

<I>She fumbles around in her sweater pocket and soon removes a card of blueish-violet, thick, sturdy.</i>

<i>She hands the card to KEVIN.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> I... SEE.

<I>He's never seen this card before.</i>

<i>He returns it.</i>

> PLEASE, AVAELLE. COME INSIDE.

<I>He lets her into the house and leads her to the sitting area where is displayed a mid-sized flatscreen television.</i>

> PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ENTERTAIN YOURSELF; THE BOOKS --

> [gesturing]

> ARE FOR FREE PERUSAL AS WELL.

> I HAVE TO CALL MY ASSISTANT.

> YOU SAID THIS IS FOR... A CAT?

<I>Neither party object to what is a mysterious non-sequitor; AVAELLE has brought no such animal with her.</i>

### AVAELLE ###

> YEAH. MY CAT XIB NEEDS TO BE NEUTERED.

> HE'S BEEN FIGHTING A LOT AND CAUSING TROUBLE WITH THE LOCALS.

### KEVIN ###

> I SEE...

<I>KEVIN leaves the room and steps into the kitchen.</i>

<i>He picks up his cellphone from the counter and repeats a few familiar keystrokes.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> STRAUD?

> YOU 'WAKE?

### STRAUD ###

> UNFORTUNATELY.

> WHAT TROUBLES YOU?

### KEVIN ###

> THE DOCTOR'S PET HAS WANDERED HER WAY TO MY HOME AND INSISTS...

> SHE NEEDS TO NEUTER HER CAT.

> SHE HAS... BROUGHT NO SUCH ANIMAL WITH HER.

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WANDERED FROM THE CITY ALL THE WAY TO YOUR DOMICILE?

### KEVIN ###

> SHE MUST HAVE TAKEN THE BUS. 

> VISUAL INSPECTION SUGGESTED NO EXCESSIVE WEAR/TEAR.

> I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCEEDINGS.

### STRAUD ###

> I WOULD PREFER TO BE PRESENT, YES.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE MIGHT LISTEN BETTER TO YOU ANYWAY.

<I>The conversation pauses for a moment.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WANDERED FREE OF INFLUENCE?

> I THOUGHT MY OLD ACQUAINTANCE WAS USING HER TO TRAIN THE TANG GIRL IN THE OLD WAYS.

> BUT HE'S SO SENTIMENTAL, I AM SURPRISED HE LET HER FREE OF HIS OVERSIGHT FOR EVEN A MOMENT.

### KEVIN ###

> OUR RECORDS SHOW THAT HE IS TRYING TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF IN THE LOCAL MEDICAL COMMUNITY.

> IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME HE FAKED HIS CREDENTIALS.

### STRAUD ###

> ACCESS TO MACHINERY AND FINE TOOLS, NO DOUBT.

> THERE IS ONLY SO FAR A HERMIT CAN GET IN THE MODERN AGE.

### KEVIN ###

> I HOPE YOU DO NOT MEAN TO IMPLICATE YOURSELF.

### STRAUD ###

> IT'S NOT NOT TRUE.

> REGARDLESS.

> THE REIGN OF TERROR FOR MOST PROFESSIONALS DARES TO SUGGEST A DATE OF DISMISSAL.

> BUT MEDICINE IS IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN.

> THE HUMAN BODY TOO FINICKY TO ALLOW THE IDLE TINKER MUCH POWER.

> TOO COSTLY, MISTAKES ARE.

> AND YET THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS PREDICATED ON MUTUAL TRUST THAT ONE WONDERS DESERVED.

> BUT IT IS OF NO MATTER.

> THE FACT IS THAT MY DEAR OLD FRIEND HAS LEFT HIS BACK DOOR OPEN AND HIS DEAR FELINE HAS WANDERED INTO OUR YARD.

### KEVIN ###

> MY FATHER SEEMS TO HAVE PROVIDED AT LEAST SOME GUIDANCE.

### STRAUD ###

> HE WOULD. THE REDS ARE OFTEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF HIS PITIES.

<I>The two cease their conversation.</i>

<i>KEVIN pauses a little while, the ambiance suggesting that AVAELLE has turned on the television and is flipping through channels.</i>

<i>When he re-enters, AVAELLE is seated on the floor in front of the television.</i>

### VINCENT ###

> PERHAPS SHE'S MISSING HER VISUAL AID. 

> SHE CAN SPLIT THE STREAM, YOU KNOW.

> IF EVER WE HAD NEED OF NUMBERS...

> [he sighs and dismisses the thought.]

> IT DOES MAKE TELEVISION WATCHING SO MUCH MORE...

> ENTERTAINING.

<I>KEVIN strolls toward her.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> AVAELLE... "EASTON"; WAS IT?

### AVAELLE ###

> YES, THAT'S IT.

> AVAELLE EASTON.

### KEVIN ###

> I'VE JUST PHONED MY ASSISTANT.

> HE'LL BE WITH US SHORTLY.

> HE'S A GOOD MAN. I DON'T DO ANY SERIOUS PROCEDURES WITHOUT HIM.

> STEADY HAND, THAT ONE.

> [pause, looks toward the television.]

> YOU, UH, LIKE THE NEWS?

### AVAELLE ###

> OH? UH.

<I>AVAELLE suddenly seems embarrassed for sitting on the floor and flees her position, going toward the couch.</i>

> I DON'T KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

> I JUST HATE IT WHEN THEY START TO REPEAT THE STORIES.

> LIKE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH GOING ON IN THIS WIDE WORLD FOR THEM NOT TO REPEAT THEMSELVES.

> JUST SEEMS UNLIKELY.

### KEVIN ###

> I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

> NOW, YOU SAID YOU NEEDED...

> VETERINARY SERVICES.

### AVAELLE ###

> SURE DO.

> IT'S A PROBLEM WITH MY CAT. 

> HE THINKS AND ACTS LIKE A MALE BUT I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT HE'S NOT MALE AT ALL.

> OR AT LEAST NOT AS --

### KEVIN ###

> PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE SUBSCRIBING TO THE THREE-GENDER THEORY.

### AVAELLE ###

> I... UH...

> [pause; fiddles idly with hands]

### KEVIN ###

> AVAELLE. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT REPRODUCTION ON EARTH REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE.

> THERE IS ONLY A THIRD SEX IF YOU CONSIDER THE ABSENCE OF FUNCTIONAL GONADS TO BE A SEX ITSELF.

> WE OTHERWISE REFER TO THAT STATE OF BEING AS "NEUTER".

### AVAELLE ###

> RIGHT. "NEUTER".

### KEVIN ###

> YOU REALLY MUST BE CAREFUL TO NOT BELIEVE EVERY ONE-OFF EPISODE OF STAR TREK.

### AVAELLE ###

> "STAR TREK"?

### KEVIN ###

> [sigh]

> YES. "STAR TREK". NOW, PLEASE, TELL ME HOW YOUR EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING TELEVISION, BE IT "STAR TREK", OR OTHERWISE, HAS BEEN FOR YOU. SPARE NO DETAILS.

### AVAELLE ###

> WATCHING TELEVISION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ME LATELY.

> IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THE STORIES...

### KEVIN ###

> YES? 

> GO ON.

<I>She seems at a loss for words.</i>

> DO YOU SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SOUNDTRACK --

> AH. PERHAPS I SHOULD BE LESS SPECIFIC...

> IT IS OFTEN NOT SOUND BUT INSTEAD RAW FEELING --

> SENSE-CONCEPTS

> IDEA-DATA

> SOMETHING THAT SPEAKS ONLY TO YOU?

### AVAELLE ###

> MY FEAR IS NOT THAT IT'S TAILORMADE FOR ME, BUT INSTEAD THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS IT.

> BUT PERHAPS YOU DO TOO.

> IS YOUR HAIRCOLOR NATURAL?

### KEVIN ###

> "NATURAL"?

> I ADMIT, MY HAIR HAS CHANGED IN MY LIFE...

### VINCENT ###

> DON'T BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH.

> SHE MEANS TO INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER YOU ARTIFICIALLY COLOR YOUR HAIR;

> BY EXTENSION, THOUGH SHE CANNOT HOPE TO KNOW THE DEEPER MEANING OF WHAT SHE ASKS,

> IF YOU TWO SHARE A HERITAGE, AN ANCIENT MOTHER.

> SHE IS COMPLETELY IGNORANT.

### KEVIN ###

> I DO NOT COLOR MY HAIR.

### AVAELLE ###

> I'VE HAD PARANOIA THAT HAIR COLOR MAY INDICATE SOMETHING OF THE BRAIN IT IS INTENDED TO SHELTER.

### KEVIN ###

> WHAT OF BODY HAIR, THEN?

### AVAELLE ###

> THE NERVES.

> THEY BRANCH THEMSELVES INSIDE EACH DIGIT.

> IF NERVES TRANSMIT ELECTRICAL IMPULSE THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO THOSE CERTAIN KINDS OF DATA.

### KEVIN ###

> HAIR DAMPENS THE IMPULSES FROM THE PERIPHERALS.

### AVAELLE ###

> BUT WHY IS IT COLORED? WHY IS IT NOT JUST...

### KEVIN, VINCENT ###

> "MONKIEES".

### KEVIN ###

> "MONKIEES"?

### AVAELLE ###

> "MONKIEES"?

<I>The conversation has no idea where to go next.</i>

<i>The television continues to blare.</i>

> IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THE STORIES ARE ABOUT ME -- OR THAT I'VE SEEN THE EPISODE BEFORE WHEN IT'S CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.

> BUT I'VE STOPPED WATCHING IT BECAUSE IT JUST BECAME UNFUN.

> MY ROOMMATE WATCHES FROM TIME TO TIME BUT USUALLY SHE USES THE COMPUTER AND WATCHES FROM THERE.

> I'VE HAD... DESTRUCTIVE IMPULSES.

> AS YOU WOULD WITH ANYTHING YOU THINK IS TRYING TO HYPNOTIZE YOU, I WANTED TO DESTROY THEM.

> BUT... SOMETHING HELD ME BACK.

### KEVIN ###

> IF YOU COULD ONLY WATCH ONE FILM...

### AVAELLE ###

> [inter.] GAY PURREE, OF COURSE.

### KEVIN ###

> ARE YOU THE HERO OR THE ANTI-HERO?

### AVAELLE ###

> THE DAMSEL?

### KEVIN ###

> YES.

> [pause]

> OF COURSE.

> WHO IS YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER?

### AVAELLE ###

> MY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER?

### KEVIN ###

> YOUR DOCTOR, AVAELLE.

> WHO IS YOUR DOCTOR?

### AVAELLE ###

> I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR DOCTOR. I JUST GO TO THE CLINIC WHEN I FEEL BADLY.

### KEVIN ###

> DOES THE NAME "DOCTOR LENARD MCCOY" MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

### AVAELLE ###

> "DOCTOR LENARD MCCOY". ISN'T THAT THE NAME OF THE OLD BADGER IN --

### KEVIN ###

> STAR TREK. "THE ORIGINAL SERIES".

### AVAELLE ###

> HE WAS THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN FOR THAT ENTIRE SHIP.

### KEVIN ###

> INDEED HE WAS.

### AVAELLE ###

> "I'M A DOCTOR, NOT A _______!"

### KEVIN ###

> YES, THAT WAS ONE OF THE JOKES THAT BECAME A MAINSTAY.

> I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO INFORM YOU OF THIS, BUT...

> AVAELLE...

> THAT MAN WAS YOUR DOCTOR.

> HE IS NOT JUST A GHOST INSIDE A TELEVISION.

> I HAVE ACCESS TO A GREAT DEAL OF DATABASES AND ALL SIGNS POINT TO HIM AS YOUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER.

### AVAELLE ###

> HE'S ...

> NOT JUST A CHARACTER ON TV?

> WAS THAT AN...

### KEVIN ###

> ILLUSION.

> WHAT'S MORE IS THAT HE HAS LAPSED IN HIS CARE OF YOU.

> THAT'S WHY YOU ARE HERE.

> YOU HAVE TROUBLE CREATING AND ACCESSING TRUE MEMORY.

> HE WAS GIVING YOU MEDICATION TO AMELIORATE SOME OF THAT, ALONG WITH USING THE TELEVISION TO IMPLANT FUNCTIONAL PLACES AND THINGS INTO YOUR MIND.

> TO FILL THE GAPS, SO TO SPEAK.

> BUT EITHER YOU CEASED YOUR MEDICATION OR HE ERRED, AVAELLE.

> AND THAT'S HOW YOU ENDED UP HERE.

### AVAELLE ###

> I... I... SEE.

### KEVIN ###

> WHAT WAS YOUR LAST JOB?

### AVAELLE ###

> I HAVEN'T HAD A JOB IN A LONG TIME.

### KEVIN ###

> TRY TO REMEMBER.

### AVAELLE ###

> I'M NOT SURE I EVER HAD A REAL JOB.

> I WAS TRYING TO HELP MY YOUNGER SISTER THROUGH SCHOOL.

> I DID MORE OF HER HOMEWORK THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE.

> SHE WAS STUDYING...

### KEVIN ###

> FINANCE?

### AVAELLE ###

> YEAH! IT WAS FINANCE.

> WAS THAT JUST A LUCKY GUESS?

### KEVIN ###

> LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STUDYING THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF WEALTH THESE DAYS.

> I SUPPOSE IT'S PRACTICAL ENOUGH.

### AVAELLE ###

> I GUESS I SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH.

> SHE ISN'T ACTUALLY MY SISTER.

> I JUST LIKED TO IMAGINE THAT SHE WAS.

> I DON'T REMEMBER MY PARENTS.

> I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD A SISTER.

### KEVIN ###

> HOW DID YOU MEET YOUR SISTER?

### AVAELLE ###

> AN ART SHOWING. 

> A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL WAS DOING A GALLERY.

### KEVIN ###

> AND YOU WENT OF YOUR OWN FREE-WILL?

### AVAELLE ###

> WELL, OF COURSE.

> I HAVE LITTLE ELSE TO DO.

> MY PARENTS LEFT ME A LARGE INHERITANCE BUT THERE'S JUST NOTHING I FIND WORTHY OF SPENDING MONEY ON.

> PAINT. FOOD.

> FOOD. PAINT.

> FOOD. PAINT.

### KEVIN ###

> YOU MENTION YOUR PARENTS. DO YOU HAVE ANY --

### AVAELLE ###

> MEMORIES?

> NO, I'M SURE THAT I DON'T.

> IT WAS A STORY, A FEELING WITHOUT A SOURCE.

> A TRUTH WITHOUT CAUSE.

> LIKE... LIKE... A MORAL THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE TAUGHT.

> THAT CAUSING PAIN IN OTHERS IS WRONG.

> THAT STEALING IS SELFISH.

> THAT LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE.

### KEVIN ###

> LIKE A DREAM WHERE YOU RECOGNIZE AN INDIVIDUAL BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THEIR FACE.

> BUT THE DREAM IS ABLE TO ACT ON, PULL ON, YOUR MEMORY DIRECTLY, WITHOUT REQUIRING THE STIMULI WE DO IN OUR WAKING HOURS: SIGHT, SMELL, VOICE, TOUCH...

### AVAELLE ###

> THE MEMORIES I HAVE, ALL ARTIFICIAL?

### KEVIN ###

> SURELY NOT ALL OF THEM.

> AND FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, YOU SEEM TO ALREADY BE ATTEMPTING TO RID YOURSELF OF FAULTY DATA.

> YOU CAME HERE, DID YOU NOT?

> AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE DOCTOR.

> THAT, AT LEAST, MEANS SOMETHING.

> HE IS MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

### AVAELLE ###

> MY DOCTOR IS IN LOVE WITH ME?

### KEVIN ###

> TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY.

> THERE IS A LONG STORY THAT GOES WITH IT.

> AND I SUPPOSE IT IS A BIT UNFAIR TO SAY HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU, "YOU", SPECIFICALLY...

### AVAELLE ###

> I DON'T...

### KEVIN ###

> HOLD ON...

### AVAELLE ###

> MY SISTER?

### KEVIN ###

> NO. DECIDEDLY NOT YOUR SISTER.

> VANESSA SOUGHT YOUR MENTORSHIP AS A PAINTER?

### AVAELLE ###

> [opens mouth speechlessly]

### KEVIN ###

> [hears the Count scuttling about the gravestones]

### AVAELLE ###

> SHE DID VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ME HAVING PURCHASED HER PAINTING.

> WE TALKED FOR A WHILE.

> WE GOT ALONG WELL.

> I DIDN'T REALIZE WHEN SHE WANTED MENTORSHIP, SHE WANTED HOUSING AS WELL.

### KEVIN ###

> HOLD YOUR THOUGHT; I BELIEVE MY ASSISTANT HAS ARRIVED.

<I>KEVIN leaves the sitting area to attend to the front door. He exits.</i>

<i>Her attention returns to the television. VLADISLAUS STRAUD enters the home with KEVIN in attendance.</i>

<i>He speaks. Loudly.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> AVAELLE EASTON.

<I>AVAELLE turns toward him, a little shocked at his chosen volume.</i>

> MY NAME IS VLADISLAUS STRAUD.

> WE'VE MET BEFORE.

### AVAELLE ###

> [confusion] WE HAVE?

### STRAUD ###

> IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. NEARING TWO-HUNDRED YEARS.

### AVAELLE ###

> [titters dismissively] TWO-HUNDRED YEARS? 

> YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

### STRAUD ###

> THEN, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

> YOU LOOK NOT A DAY OVER FORTY.

### AVAELLE ###

> I STOPPED COUNTING.

> THIRTY-FIVE?

### STRAUD ###

> YOU MEAN YOU NEVER STARTED.

> WHO IS YOUR FATHER, AVAELLE?

### AVAELLE ###

> I... I... DON'T KNOW.

### STRAUD ###

> YOU ARE HALF-RIGHT.

> YOU ARE NOT BORN OF MAN AND WOMAN, AVAELLE.

> YOU WERE CREATED, CLONED, COPIED.

> FROM AN ANCIENT BLOODLINE.

> BUT YOU'VE BEEN DENIED.

> YOU ARE THE LAST OF YOUR KIND.

> NO DATA STRUCTURE SUCH AS DNA MAY LAST FOREVER.

### AVAELLE ###

> A CLONE? 

> BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS POSSIBLE YET.

> I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THE SHEEP...

### VINCENT ###

> "SHEEP-FOR-BRAINS"?

### KEVIN ###

> "I AM" SHEEP FOR BRAINS.

### VINCENT ###

> THAT REALLY WAS QUITE UNPLEASANT.

### KEVIN ###

> YOU'RE TELLING ME.

### STRAUD ###

> YOUR DOCTOR HAS...

> POWERFUL FRIENDS.

> FRIENDS ABLE TO MAKE MORE THAN JUST A TEST-TUBE EWE.

> HE COMES FROM A PLACE WHERE SUCH FEATS ARE EASILY ACCOMPLISHED.

> HE'S HAD TO TAKE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO WORK HIS CRAFT ON EARTH, BUT HE'S ONLY UNDER THE FEAR OF HIS PATRON'S WHIP;

> HE HIMSELF FREED FROM THE THREAT OF DEATH FROM AGE OR DISEASE.

> BUT YOU ARE FROM EARTH, MADE OF EARTH.

> YOU ARE SPECIAL, YOUR LINE UNIQUE, MORE VALUABLE THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

> THAT IS JUST ONE REASON THAT THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN INFATUATED WITH YOUR LINE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

> YOUR BODY MAY BE THIRTY-FIVE OR HOWEVER MANY YOU CLAIM, BUT YOUR SOUL-STUFF, BOUND, IMPRISONED, ALMOST, TO YOUR DNA, IS FAR OLDER THAN THAT.

> YOUR MEMORY LAPSES CERTAINLY INDICATE THAT YOU ARE THE LAST OF YOUR KIND. YOUR...

### KEVIN ###

> LET'S CALL HER YOUR MOTHER.

### VINCENT ###

> GOOD CALL.

### STRAUD ###

> YOUR MOTHER DOES NOT SUFFER SUCH AN UNFAIR ILLNESS.

### AVAELLE ###

> MY... "MOTHER"?

### STRAUD ###

> I STRUGGLE TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE TERM, SO THAT IS THE CLOSEST I CAN THINK OF.

> YOU NOW KNOW THAT YOU ARE A CLONE, THE LAST OF YOUR KIND.

> BUT WE -- MY FRIENDS AND I WHO REFUSE AFFILIATION WITH DOCTOR MCCOY AND HIS ASSOCIATES --

> ARE GUARDIANS OVER AN ELDER CLONE OF YOUR LINE.

> I SUPPOSE IT IS DISINGENUOUS TO SAY SHE DOES NOT SUFFER YOUR ILLNESS --

> SHE HAS HER OWN WEAKNESSES, LIKE YOURSELF.

> YOU WERE MADE BY MODERN MEDICINE; 

> SHE OWES HER EXISTENCE TO THE DOCTOR'S EUGENICS PROGRAM, ONLY DISCOVERED BY ME...

> LATE.

> TWO-HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

> I SAY I MET YOU THEN, AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNTRUE, BUT YOU WERE BUT A TWINKLE IN YOUR MOTHER'S EYE THEN.

> IT WAS WITH HER THE DOCTOR BECAME INFATUATED.

> BUT I WILL STOP HERE, LEST THE HISTORY LESSON BECOME SATURATED WITH THE FINER POINTS.

### KEVIN ###

> PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONTINUE, SIR.

> UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CAN CARRY SUCH TREMENDOUS WEIGHT WITH THEM.

### VINCENT ###

> I'LL SAY.

### STRAUD ###

> YOU SPOKE EARLIER OF YOUR SISTER, VANESSA TANG.

> AND I TOLD YOU OF THE DOCTOR'S CURSE; THAT HE CAN NO LONGER PERISH OF OLD AGE OR DISEASE.

> THESE TWO... AS WELL AS...

> [lifts hand and places it upon chest, as if to indicate himself]

> "MYSELF"...

> ARE WHAT THE PEOPLE OF EARTH CALL "VAMPIRES".

> EVERY VAMPIRE IS UNHAPPY IN HIS OWN WAY BUT IN PLAIN TONGUE ALL ARE ALIKE.

> SURELY YOUR EDUCATION GIVEN YOU BY THE...

> [looks toward the television, pausing to wince]

> TELEVISION HAS TAUGHT YOU SOMETHING OF OUR KIND.

### AVAELLE ###

> THE FILM: EARLY NINETIES. BRAM STOKER'S...

### STRAUD ###

> [inter.] YES YES YES. WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH IT.

> AND FAMILIAR WITH HIM.

> BUT WE ARE NOT LIKE HIM.

### KEVIN ###

> LET US NOT CONFUSE THE ISSUE...

### STRAUD ###

> [lamentingly] FINE.

> SINCE YOU INSIST, I WILL CLARIFY.

> THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE MURD'YR AND OURSELVES.

> I DON'T PREFER TO ENUMERATE THEM BUT IN THE INTEREST OF ACADEMIC CLARITY, YES, THERE ARE SIMILIARITIES.

> ONE OF THE AWOKEN...

> [sigh]

> "UNDEAD"...

> DOES NOT SUBSIST ON FRUITS AND CORN OF THE EARTH'S SOIL.

> HE IS CURSED TO CONSUME THE BLOOD OF HUMANITY.

> DRAKUL... A KILLER.

> BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR OUR KIND TO KILL.

> THAT IS THE GIFT.

> WHERE A MAN MUST CUT CABBAGE FROM THE ROOT, DRAIN THE BLOOD OF THE FLESH OF A DEAD ANIMAL...

> WE ARE... IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT: MILK-DRINKERS.

### VINCENT ###

> NOW THAT IS PUTTING A POSITIVE SPIN ON THINGS.

### KEVIN ###

> THAT PARTICULAR IMAGERY IS A BIT CONFUSED.

> MILK IS PRODUCED BY A MOTHER FOR HER SPECIFIC CHILD.

> BUT IT IS TRUE THAT ALL SHE EATS MUST BE CUT FROM THE EARTH TO GRANT HER SUSTINANCE TO CREATE SUCH A MEAL.

> IN THAT WAY, WE ARE ALIKE.

> BUT THE DRAINING OF BLOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS NOT THEFT, BUT IS GIVEN OF ONE'S FREE-WILL, REQUIRES NO SUCH CULLING.

> IT IS EVEN TRUE THT IT MAY GRANT THE GIVER TRUE-SLEEP -- WHEREIN THE HUMAN, AS IF AFTER A SLOUGHING, HAS LIKENED DESANGUINATION AS AN EXFOLIATION TO DRIVE THE CREATION OF FRESH, NEW BLOOD.

> TRUE-SLEEP IS A GIFT, A RESPITE, FROM THE SLEEPLESSNESS THAT PLAGUES SO MANY OF THE WOULD-BE DREAMERS.

### STRAUD ###

> SOME OF THE VAMPIRES COME FROM THE OLD WORLD, LIKE MYSELF, LIKE YOUR DOCTOR.

> BUT OTHERS ARE CONVERTED.

> THEY ARE BORN HUMAN BUT GIVEN THE GIFT; THE CURSE.

> YOUR ANTECEDENT WAS ONE SUCH CONVERT.

> IT IS NOT SO... EASY FOR THE MORTALS TO SLIP INTO.

> BUT BEFORE I MAY CONTINUE, I NEED REST. YOU, TOO, NEED REST.
