You are my moonbeam<br/>
parody of <br/>
you are my sunshine<br/>
originally by the <br/>
pine ridge boys

I had a day-mare, as I lay dozing<br/>
a fevered vision of time gone by<br/>
you were a doll, dear, and I a skel'ton<br/>
and I knew we both had died

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam<br/>
you break my debuffs when times are blue<br/>
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two<br/>
please don't tilt my moonbeam askew

a secret shared, girl, became a lover<br/>
each morning bless-ed by your sweet kiss<br/>
but now you're wishing to be my brother<br/>
lasting 'wake is no such bliss

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam<br/>
you break my debuffs when times are blue<br/>
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two<br/>
please don't tilt my moonbeam askew

your voice a chorus of fotons merry<br/>
your gentle eying warms me so<br/>
but if your Talent, you leave behind you<br/>
you'll regret it all some day 

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam<br/>
you break my debuffs when times are blue<br/>
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two<br/>
please don't tilt my moonbeam askew
