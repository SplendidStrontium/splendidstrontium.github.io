### // STRAUD MANSION //

<br><i>When Vincent Marscapone arrives at my home, he's already been driving for quite some time. He had that hassled exasperation that one might expect from one scaling a mountain.</i>

<i>But this time, I know there's something different on his mind.</i>

<i>He did not often make social visits and his mood is somber.</i>

#### STRAUD

> SALUTATIONS, OLD FRIEND.

#### VINCENT

> PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

<BR><I>I step away from the door to allow him entrance. He obliges, swiftly and efficiently, and waits until the door is closed before he begins to speak.</i>

#### VINCENT

> MY SON HAS GONE MISSING.
> 
> I HAVE COME LOOKING FOR ANY REASON IT MIGHT NOT BE YOUR OLD RIVAL.

#### STRAUD

> YOUR SON IS MISSING?
> 
> MY DEAR FRIEND. MY CONDOLENCES.

#### VINCENT

> I WILL SAVE YOUR CONDOLENCES, THOUGH I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN.
> 
> HE IS NOT DEAD YET.
> 
> HIS DOORS WERE LEFT OPEN AND HE'S NOT RETURNED FOR HOURS.
> 
> MY SON WOULD NOT BE SO CARELESS AS TO RUN AWAY.
> 
> I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

#### STRAUD

> HAS YOUR WIFE SCRIED FOR HIM?

#### VINCENT

> SHE BELIEVES HIM CAPTIVE BUT CANNOT SAY BY WHOM.
> 
> THERE ARE NO MARKS, NO WORDS, NO CLUES.
> 
> AND THEN I LEFT HER TO COME TO YOU.

#### STRAUD

> I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHT THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'RE A GREAT DEAL MORE USEFUL THAN YOU SELF-REPRESENT.
> 
> I SUPPOSE TO KEEP THE ONLOOKERS AWAY FROM YOUR GRAND CASTLE.

<BR><I>I say nothing, sensing the conversation straying from its original intent.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOU SAY YOUR SON IS MISSING.
> 
> HAVE YOU DETECTED ANY RECENT CHANGE IN HIS BEHAVIOR?
> 
> CAGINESS? A RETICENCE TO ENGAGE? AN OVERINDULGENCE IN PRIVACY SEEKING --

#### VINCENT

> NO. NOTHING.
> 
> IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL DAYS SINCE I'VE SEEN THE CHILD BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN UNUSUAL.
> 
> I ADMIT THE THOUGHTS OF CHILDREN CAN BE FRENZIED, CAPRICIOUS, BUT...
> 
> HE IS A CALM, THINKING BOY. I DO NOT BELIEVE HE'S RUN AWAY, REGARDLESS OF MY PERSONAL FEELINGS REGARDING THE MATTER...
> 
> REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY TIMES I MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY.

#### STRAUD

> YOUR BOY WOULD BE A PRIZE FOR SOMEONE LIKE MY RIVAL.
> 
> I SUSPECT HE'S CAUGHT UP IN THE GENOME PROJECT AND SOMEONE LIKE YOUR SON WOULD BE A FEATHER IN HIS CAP.

#### VINCENT

> AND WHAT CAUSE WOULD HE HAVE TO BRING SOMEONE OF OUR REALM TO HIS?
> 
> HE ONLY RISKS THE REVEAL.
> 
> AND FOR WHAT, SOME LONG LIST OF ENCODED BASE PAIRS?

#### STRAUD

> HE HAS MORE FRIENDS THAN WE CAN FATHOM. 
> 
> ALL HE NEED DO IS SEW TOGETHER HIS PATCHWORK QUILT AND ANY MORTAL WILL FORGET ANY QUESTIONS HE'D IMAGINED.

#### VINCENT

> IF HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO EXTRACT --

<BR><I>Vincent stumbles on his words, getting indignant at the thought.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I DO NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT, BUT I SUSPECT HE'S TRYING TO GLEAN INFORMATION ABOUT THE MUNDANES.

#### VINCENT

> MY SON IS NOT A MUNDANE!!

#### STRAUD

> PRECISELY WHY EXTRACTING DATA FROM HIS GENES MAY HAVE BEEN TOO TEMPTING TO PASS UP.
> 
> PERHAPS HE AIMS TO SEPARATE OUT THE INCLINATION TOWARD MAGIC.

#### VINCENT

> HE SHOULD KNOW THAT THE WEAVE IS FAR MORE DISCRIMINATING THAN THAT.
> 
> HE THINKS HE CAN CREATE A SENSITIVITY AND STRENGTH THAT WERE GOD-GIVEN.

#### STRAUD

> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY HE WANTS.
> 
> BUT I DO NOT THINK HE IS AIMING TO CURE CANCER.

<BR><I>Vincent's tone takes on a certain deviousness.</i>

#### VINCENT

> SO THEN WE GO IN WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE.

#### STRAUD

> IT SEEMS SO.

#### VINCENT

> ARE YOU FINE IN RISKING IT?
> 
> YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH LENARD?

#### STRAUD

> WHAT FRIENDSHIP?
