### // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<BR><I>Cedric has left Kevin behind and fled into the basement sanctum in an effort at solitude. But he has been followed by the house's Elder.</i>

#### VINCENT

> GET CLEANED UP. 
> 
> WE'RE GOING OUT.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WEAR?
> 
> ALL MY CLOTHES --

#### VINCENT

> IT DOESN'T MATTER.
> 
> LOOK THROUGH THE DRAWERS, TAKE ANYTHING YOU FIND SUITABLE.

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T THINK KEVIN'S CLOTHES WILL FIT ME.

#### VINCENT

> DID I SAY THAT THEY WOULD?

#### CEDRIC

> IS THIS HOW YOU USUALLY DO THINGS?

<BR><I>Vincent straightens his back.</i>

#### VINCENT

> IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNGLINGS TO FEED EARLY AND OFTEN, LEST THE BEAST TAKE HOLD.
> 
> WHEN YOU ARE MORE EXPERIENCED, YOU CAN FIND PREY ON YOUR OWN TIME.
> 
> BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU AND KEVIN AND SEE THAT THINGS ARE SET UP FOR YOUR SUCCESS.
> 
> WE'RE GOING TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.

#### CEDRIC

> THE BOWLING ALLEY?

#### VINCENT

> DID I STUTTER?

#### CEDRIC

> I'M TERRIBLE AT BOWLING. 
> 
> I HATE IT.

#### VINCENT

> IT DOES NOT MATTER.
> 
> THE MORTALS WILL HAVE NO CONCERN FOR YOUR SCORECARD.

#### CEDRIC

> CAN'T WE JUST GO TO A BAR OR SOMETHING?

#### VINCENT

> NOT TONIGHT.

<BR><I>Cedric opens the drawer to find a plethora of tightly rolled shirts in plain, drab colors.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO IN WHAT I HAVE ON.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>The trio collect at the basement door and step out into a cool night. They walk along in silence for quite some time, each dealing with their anxieties in their own way.</i>

<i>Every break in their formation suggests an escape route. The crisp air an invitation to flee. He'd leave this madhouse and look for a cure for this curse on his own.</i>

#### VINCENT

> BARS ARE NOT THE EASIEST PLACES TO HUNT. 
> 
> A YOUNGLING CAN EASILY FALL TO SECOND-HAND SMOKE -- THE FEELING OF DRUNKENNESS CAUGHT FROM THE UNSUSPECTING AMONG YOU.
> 
> THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS MINGLE WITH YOURS. 
> 
> IT CLOUDS YOUR FOCUS.
> 
> NOT TO MENTION IT'S A PRIME PLACE TO CATCH OLD MEMORIES GATHERING ON THE WIND.

#### KEVIN

> PLUS I CAN'T GET IN.

#### VINCENT

> PLUS HE CAN'T GET IN.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU DON'T HAVE A FAKE ID?
> 
> I CAN --

<BR><I>No. He couldn't get him anything. He had nothing.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I CERTAINLY LOOK THE PART.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'RE NEARLY READY.
> 
> WE HAVE AVENUES.

<BR><I>In the streetlight, the two of them seemed to glow and their skin seemed more alabaster than rose. </i>

<i>Would this befall him, too?</i>
<br><br>

*****
#### BETHANY

> BETHANY.

#### AMANDA

> AMANDA.

#### TRISHA

> TRISHA.

#### TIFFANY

> TIFFANY.

<BR><I>Four young women took the alley next to theirs. Cedric felt little but revulsion choked by the stench of shoes. </i>

#### TRISHA

> IS THAT YOUR DAD?

#### KEVIN

> YEAH.

#### TRISHA

> YOU'RE THE SPITTING IMAGE!

#### KEVIN

> THANK YOU.

#### AMANDA

> TRISH!
> 
> IT'S YOUR TURN!

<BR><I>Finally a moment of silence. Cedric turns to Kevin as they take seats next to one another.</i>

<I>He lowers his voice to take advantage of the privacy afforded by the din of the alley.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WOMEN?

#### KEVIN

> WHY DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T KNOW. 
> 
> SOME CLAIM OF CHIVALRY.

#### KEVIN

> I'M NOT SEXIST.

#### CEDRIC

> NEITHER AM I...
> 
> JUST...

#### VINCENT

> CEDRIC! 
> 
> YOU'RE UP.

<BR><I>Cedric picks up the bowling ball and rolls it down the lane.</i>

<i>The girls clap for him and allow him to rejoin his conversation with Kevin.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME HOW.

#### KEVIN

> IT'S LIKE INSTINCT.
> 
> IT'LL COME TO YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

#### KEVIN

> FOLLOW YOUR FANGS.

<BR><I>Cedric runs his tongue along his teeth. They felt...still...ordinary.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MINE WERE LIKE A KITTEN'S.
> 
> UNFORGIVINGLY SHARP.

<BR><I>He turns from Cedric and leaves to talk to the women. </i>

<i>In his absence, Cedric looks at Vincent. He returns the gaze before coming to sit in the abandoned seat.</i>

#### VINCENT

> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FAIRLY GOOD FOR HATING THE GAME.

#### CEDRIC

> IT REMINDS ME OF THINGS I'D RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT.

#### VINCENT

> YOU HAD BETTER GET USED TO IT.
> 
> GROWING UP MEANS YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO THINK.
> 
> THANKFULLY YOU ENJOY BOOKS, DON'T YOU?

#### CEDRIC

> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

#### VINCENT

> YOU WERE A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

#### CEDRIC

> THE HEADMISTRESS?

#### VINCENT

> SHE IS A BIT OF A GOSSIP.

#### CEDRIC

> I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'LL BE FINE.
>
