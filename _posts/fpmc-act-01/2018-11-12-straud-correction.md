<br><i>I continue my playing and wait for CEDRIC to roll up in the driveway.</i>

<i>I am just losing myself in the music when I hear the tell-tale approach of AVAEL. She's undergone, and is undergoing, a number of mechanical modifications to her body. She's given up her ability to shapeshift in favor of technological mutability. It's not a choice I would have made but I've supported her insofar as I am able.</i>

<i>She approaches my seven o'clock.</i>

#### AVAEL

> WHEN IS MANDARC RETURNING?

#### STRAUD

> I DON'T KNOW. 
> 
> CEDRIC WANTS TO GO FETCH HIM.
> 
> HE DOESN'T TRUST THE WITCH.

#### AVAEL

> DO YOU, SIR?

#### STRAUD

> I'M NOT SURE, AVAEL.
> 
> I TEND TO TRUST HIM, BUT HE'S LITTLE PATIENCE FOR THE MATRON OR HER PETS.
> 
> IT COLORS HIS JUDGEMENT.
> 
> I DIDN'T LIKE THE GIRL BUT SHE SEEMED HARMLESS.

#### AVAEL

> MANDARC WAS JUST HAPPY TO BE INVITED ON A DATE.

#### STRAUD

> HE IS SENTIMENTAL IN THAT WAY.

#### AVAEL

> I SUSPECT THAT HIS APPRENTICESHIP TO THE ELDER TRELAINE HAS MADE THIS TENDENCY WITHIN HIM --
> 
> RATHER EXAGGERATED, SIR.

#### STRAUD

> THERE IS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT YOUTH EXCEPT TO WAIT IT OUT.
> 
> AND ENJOY IT.

#### AVAEL

> 'ENJOY IT', SIR?

#### STRAUD

> IF WE TAKE FROM HIM WHAT HE DESIRES, HE WILL ONLY COME TO RESENT US IN THE END.
> 
> WE WILL HAVE BURNT THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS.

#### AVAEL

> 'TO BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS', SIR?
> 
> I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THIS EXPRESSION WAS MOST PROPERLY USED --

#### STRAUD

> (quickly) YES, YES, I AM AWARE.
> 
> WHAT IS TO STOP US FROM ALLOWING HIM TO LIVE AS MEN DO?
> 
> HE IS NOT CONTENTED BY A LIFE OF SOLITUDE.

#### AVAEL

> HE'S NEVER HAD A LIFE OF SOLITUDE, SIR.
> 
> THE DOCTOR ALWAYS ENSURED THAT HIS PLAYTHINGS WERE KEPT CLOSE TO HIM.

#### STRAUD

> AS WAS DONE TO HIM SO LONG AGO.
> 
> AT ANY RATE.
> 
> I'D LIKE YOU TO WATCH THE HOUSE. 

#### AVAEL

> I AM CAPABLE OF DOING THIS.

#### STRAUD

> YOU KNOW WHERE THE PISTOLS ARE KEPT.

#### AVAEL

> INDEED, SIR.

<BR><I>CEDRIC is a mildly anxious driver. He tends to keep silent in the car, focusing his entire attention upon the task at hand. He fears being stopped by the police.</i>

<i>I understand his fear but I do not endorse it. The young man is capable of a stronger glamour than I have seen in decades. But he does not relish its use; rather, he avoids the Mortals when he is able.</i>

<i>Sometimes I think he's trying to hasten the rate at which he forgets what it was like to walk among them. I hope he's patient with himself. A thing once forgotten truly disappears into the Ether.</i>

<i>He tries to warm himself up to prepare to chide me. He is often unusually bold with me and it often hearkens to friendships long past.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I WISH YOU'D JUST HELD HIM BACK.
> 
> WE REALLY DON'T NEED THIS.
> 
> WE'RE JUST STARTING TO MOP UP THE MESS FROM THE MAGICADEMY.

<BR><I>I stay silent, a moment, letting his hostility disperse through the air. Hopefully he will answer his own questions.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WE WILL NEVER WIN HIS LOYALTY BY AFFIXING SPIKES TO THE INSIDE OF HIS COLLAR.

#### CEDRIC

> HE NEEDS US.
> 
> NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

#### STRAUD

> ARE YOU CERTAIN?

<BR><I>The traffic is a mess of bright red light but at least it is moving swiftly.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> THE WAY YOU'RE TAKING IN ORPHANS.
> 
> ONE MIGHT WONDER WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO EMULATE.

<BR><I>He refers to my recent string of conversions, including the young woman ELIZA PANCAKES and as well as the Islander MAKOA KEALOHA.</i>

<i>MANDARC, too, was brought into the fold just two years ago.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOU'VE BEEN LURKING AT THE EDGES OF ELYSION.
> 
> I KNOW YOU HAVE SEEN THE FEAR.
> 
> THE NOISE OF THE CREATURES BENEATH GROWS EVER LOUDER.
> 
> VICIOUS. HUNGRY.

#### CEDRIC

> AND WHAT'RE A BUNCH OF KIDS GOING TO DO FOR US?
> 
> ARE THE HELL-HOUNDS GOING TO WAIT WHILE WE STOP TO CHANGE A DIAPER?

#### STRAUD

> WE WERE ALL CHILDREN ONCE.
> 
> CHILDREN GROW UP.

#### CEDRIC

> NOT FAST ENOUGH.

<br><i>THE BLUE VELVET is a a safe space for my friends and followers. No man is an island. It has been a boon to my company where the Immortals may pass a night, in their words, 'as a normie'.</i>

<i>It is here MANDARC brought his companion, certain that, with a certain password, he may be served a beverage suitable to his unique physiology. My barkeepers are insiders or ask no questions. They do as they are told when someone orders, for example, a 'bloody mary without the pepper'. Sometimes money is all that is needed to ensure a man makes no complaints.</i>

<i>For a boy as young as MANDARC, it is key that he is able to ignore his compulsion in order to maintain his composure. He feeds early and often, not yet well-practiced in enduring his addiction.</i>

<i>As with all things, I preach a patient approach.</i>

<i>CEDRIC removes his car keys from his ring and passes them to the valet. We slip inside the building.</i>

<i>Inside, the building is packed with Immortals and Mortals alike. TVs blare noisily, trying to create an ambiance of normalcy for our guests.</i>

<i>As we approach MANDARC, he seems stunned and removes himself from the booth, walking up to CEDRIC, who I permit to pass in front of me.</i>

#### MANDARC

> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

<BR><I>PERKINS looks up in bewilderment at us.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU DIDN'T RESPOND TO YOUR PHONE, FUCKFACE.

#### MANDARC

> YEAH? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
> 
> IS SOMETHING...

<BR><I>He looks over CEDRIC's shoulder toward me.</i>

#### MANDARC

> THE MATTER?

#### STRAUD

> NOTHING IMMEDIATELY.
> 
> WE JUST THOUGHT YOU'D BE DONE BY NOW.
> 
> CURFEW BEING WHAT IT IS.

<BR><I>MANDARC grits his teeth at CEDRIC.</i>

#### MANDARC

> YOU COULDN'T HAVE LAID OFF MY CURFEW...
> 
> FOR ONE NIGHT?

#### CEDRIC

> WE DID.
> 
> WE ARE.
> 
> WE'RE HERE.

<BR><I>CEDRIC pushes past MANDARC in a show of domination.</i>

<i>He waves at FRIDAY.</I>

#### CEDRIC

> FRIDAY ~

> FRIDAY PERKINS ~ LONG TIME NO SEE.

#### PERKINS

> CE -- ?

#### CEDRIC

> NO, NO, NO. NAME'S CEDRIC NOW.
> 
> NICE TO SEE YOU.

#### PERKINS

> YOUR HAIR...

#### CEDRIC

> YEP, DECIDED TO GO IN FOR A DYE-JOB.
> 
> YOU KNOW. TOTALLY NEW ME.
> 
> AFTER I GOT THIS HERE SCAR.

<BR><I>CEDRIC runs a finger down the length of his face.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WAS THE FAULT OF ONE OF YOUR DARLING LITTLE CLASSMATES, YOU KNOW.

<br><i>MANDARC has been eyeing me, begging for mercy while CEDRIC has completely usurped the table.</i>

<I>I walk up to the table.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I MUST APOLOGIZE, MAD'MOISELLE, FOR THE INTRUSION.
> 
> MY ASSOCIATE WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MANDARC AND WHEN HE RECEIVED NO REPLY...
> 
> HE WORRIED.
> 
> AS WE ARE WONT TO DO.
> 
> HE INSISTED THAT WE DRIVE OVER AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.
> 
> WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JOINED YOUR TABLE?

<BR><I>MANDARC walks up and stands next to the booth containing PERKINS; on my right, while CEDRIC opposes him on my left.</i>

#### MANDARC

> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T HAVE MINDED YOUR OWN BUSINESS FOR --
> 
> ONE.
> 
> NIGHT.

<BR><I>But PERKINS strains a smile.</i>

#### PERKINS

> I DON'T KNOW...
> 
> IT'S OKAY.
> 
> NO WORRIES.
> 
> IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, PROFESSOR.

<BR><I>CEDRIC sits down in the booth across from PERKINS. MANDARC reluctantly follows suit.</i>

#### STRAUD

> AS IT IS YOU, MISS PERKINS.
> 
> I SEE YOU'VE MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MY ASSISTANT, MANDARC SOO.

<BR><I>I take this opportunity to sit on my left; next to CEDRIC but across from MANDARC.</I>

#### PERKINS

> I HAVE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING A VERY NICE EVENING.
> 
> HE WAS TELLING ME EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF YOUR WORK.

#### STRAUD

> WAS HE.

<BR><I>PERKINS looks as though she's just swallowed a frog.</i>

#### PERKINS

> WELL... YES.
> 
> YOU'RE SOMEWHAT OF A TRAVELLING MINISTER?

#### STRAUD

> 'MINSTREL' WOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE TITLE.
> 
> BUT YES. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THE MATRON MARSCAPONE WITH A NUMBER OF HER TROUBLES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.
> 
> THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CANNOT HOPE TO KNOW ON OUR OWN.
> 
> IT DOES HELP TO HAVE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
> 
> IT'S A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL INEVITABILITY.

#### CEDRIC

> HAVE YOU EVER READ 'FLATLAND'?

<BR><I>PERKINS does not, at first, realize the question is directed at her.</i>

#### PERKINS

> WHAT?

#### CEDRIC

> 'FLATLAND'. IT'S A BOOK.
> 
> (quietly) Not that the Matron would have you look at anything without moving pictures.

#### STRAUD

> IT'S A BOOK ABOUT THE CERTITUDE THAT WHAT WE KNOW PALES AGAINST WHAT IS KNOWABLE.

#### CEDRIC

> (quietly) It's one of the few things older than the old Crone herself.

#### PERKINS

> I HAVEN'T READ IT, NO.

#### CEDRIC

> WELL, YOU SHOULD SOMETIME.
> 
> EVEN A MAGIC-USER SHOULD BE WELL-VERSED IN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PLANE WE FIND OURSELVES IN.

<BR><I>PERKINS tries to stifle a blush rising to her face. She doesn't like being publically spoken of with a designation. She takes a drink.</i>

<i>She shouldn't be embarrassed; any friend of the MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC would be in on the big secret -- she should expect understanding. But I was getting the feeling that PERKINS spent a fair amount of time amongst the Mundane.</i>

<i>She was not accustomed to such familiarity.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> I'M JUST SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MATRON'S PHONE NUMBER.
> 
> DON'T YOU ALL STICK TOGETHER?

<BR><I>MANDARC has a miserable, tight-lipped expression upon his face.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I'M SURE THAT MISS PERKINS WAS NOT EXPECTING THE MATRON TO LEAVE THE HOME.
> 
> IT IS TRUE THAT THE RETIREMENT SURPRISED US ALL.
> 
> SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ENERGETIC WOMAN. EAGER TO BE UP-AND-AT'EM.

<BR><I>At this, I try to change the subject.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> I WAS A FRIEND OF THE MATRON'S HUSBAND.
> 
> I'M SURE SHE MENTIONED HIM ONCE OR TWICE.
> 
> HE PASSED SOME YEARS AGO.
> 
> I KEEP TABS ON THE MATRON AND DROP IN FOR TEA NOW AND AGAIN.
> 
> BUT LET US NOT RELY ON GOSSIP ANY MORE HEAVILY THAN IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
> 
> TELL US, MISS PERKINS, HOW YOU BUSY YOUR DAYS.

<BR><I>She fumbles. She's lying.</i>

#### PERKINS

> I'M DOING FREELANCE WORK.
> 
> SOME ANALYTICAL PROJECTS FOR A LOCAL START-UP.
> 
> THEY DON'T PAY MUCH, BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET BY.

#### STRAUD

> I SEE. I'M SURE YOU'RE GOOD WITH YOUR MONEY AS WELL.
> 
> I HOPE MANDARC HASN'T LET YOU SURRENDER A CENT.

#### MANDARC

> WE WERE... GOING TO GO DUTCH.

#### STRAUD

> NEVER.
> 
> IT IS GOOD WE SHOWED UP THEN.
> 
> IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING PAID WELL.

<BR><I>She's trying to stay afloat in her fibs.</i>

#### PERKINS

> OH, IT'S NOT THAT, THEY'RE JUST A SMALL COMPANY.
> 
> I DON'T NEED MUCH TO GET BY.

#### STRAUD

> IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO BE WHO WE ARE.
> 
> PERHAPS I CAN FIND A BIT OF WORK FOR YOU IF YOU ARE INTERESTED.
> 
> I MANAGE MY OWN SERVERS. KEEP EVERYTHING IN-HOUSE.
> 
> CEDRIC, HERE, MANAGES THE WEB INTERFACE, BUT IT'S MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN EASILY HANDLE.

#### PERKINS

> TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I HAVEN'T DONE MUCH WITH WEBSITES.
> 
> THEY HAVE ME SCRAPING THE WEB, SURE, BUT IT'S MORE FUSSING WITH RUBY AND STRIPPING HTML TAGS FROM TEXT FILES.
> 
> IT'S NOT GLORIOUS WORK.

#### STRAUD

> WELL, YOU SEEM PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF LEARNING.
> 
> I WILL THINK ON IT AND LET YOU KNOW.
> 
> IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE SOMEONE OF YOUR TALENT ON OUR SIDE.

<BR><I>Her expression brightens.</i>

#### PERKINS

> THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HELPFUL THIS WOULD BE FOR ME.

#### STRAUD

> OH, I THINK I CAN IMAGINE. I WAS YOUNG, ONCE, TOO.
> 
> WHERE ARE YOU LIVING?

#### PERKINS

> I'M STAYING IN ALPHABET CITY.
> 
> WITH... FRIENDS --

#### STRAUD

> THAT JUST WON'T DO.
> 
> I HAVE SPACE IN ONE OF MY TOWNHOUSES.
> 
> IN HER EARLIER DAYS, THE MATRON MARSCAPONE WOULD RENT OUT HER SPACES TO HER OLDER STUDENTS.
> 
> I SUPPOSE SHE STOPPED THAT PRACTICE SOME TIME AGO.
> 
> BUT I THOUGHT IT GOOD, TO PROVIDE THE MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORT TO THE FLEDGLINGS.
> 
> DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY, MISS PERKINS?

#### PERKINS

> JUST MY GRANDMOTHER.
> 
> BUT SHE DIED A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK.

#### STRAUD

> I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
> 
> BUT IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A PLACE TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS.
> 
> PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND OUR COMPANY ENJOYABLE ON EVEN AN ORDINARY DAY.
> 
> I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST WORK IN ISOLATION.
