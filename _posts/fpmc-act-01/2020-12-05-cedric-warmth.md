## // MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME // ##

<i>CEDRIC eyes KEVIN providing a demonstration to LUCIA from the front porch. He summons a number of fireballs and extinguishes them. At this point, LUCIA has refrained from trying to summon her own.</i>

<i>KEVIN seems at ease, summoning fireballs to rival the size of the fire. The pair continue talking, but CEDRIC notes a change in the conversation when the mood turns personal.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> YOU MEAN, VAMPIRES CAN'T FEEL WARMTH?

### KEVIN ###

> 'FEEL' IS THE KEY TERM THERE. I COULD SENSE THE WARMTH, ALTHOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHICH OF MY SENSES GAVE ME THE INFORMATION.

> I COULD SEE THE LIGHT, GLEAN THE HUE, HEAR A CRACKLE AND I'D KNOW SOMETHING'S HOT OR COLD.

> I WAS A CHILD, ONCE, SO I HAD FEAR OF HEAT AND COLD.

> ONCE WE GET OLDER, IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S SENSE AND WHAT'S KNOWLEDGE.

> BUT THE FEELING OF WARMTH, YES, ELUDED ME.

> I COULD SMELL IT, KNOW A FLAME WAS THERE.

> BUT THE COMFORT OF RADIATION...

> GONE.

<I>CEDRIC steps up toward their position, silently, severely. </i>

### CEDRIC ###

> NO, WE DON'T FEEL IN THE WAY YOU DO.

> BUT THAT'S OF NO MATTER TO YOU.

<I>CEDRIC is extremely wary of those who show interest in matters that concern the walking undead.</i>

<i>What had been a cordial conversation shifts tone with CEDRIC's interjection. It is clear that he does not intend to entertain idle curiosities of the young.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> JOY, HAPPINESS, CHAOS. 

> YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU SHOULD ABOUT OUR KIND.

> DO NOT LOOK TO AGE YOURSELF PREMATURELY.

<I>CEDRIC decides to change topic.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> I MADE A PROMISE THAT I'D HELP GET ROXANNE SET UP TONIGHT.

> IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING, I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY THERE.

<i>KEVIN summons another fireball between his hands, a small one, the size of a baseball, and pushes it toward the fire, where it ignites and flares upon contact with the natural flame.</i>

<i>He focuses entirely on what he's doing, refusing eye contact with LUCIA.</I>

### KEVIN ###

> NIGHT IS A GOOD TIME TO MAKE PROGRESS.

> LUCIA, WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

<I>LUCIA is silent.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> GOOD LUCK, KIDS.

<I>CEDRIC disappears into the house to check the Net one more time before he heads out.</i>

<i>When CEDRIC arrives at ROXANNE's townhouse, the sky is midnight darkened. He rematerializes from his mist form and immediately checks that his keys are still in his pocket. </i>

<i>They are.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> (thinking) Magic is... everywhere.

<i>He thinks back to his attempt at intimidation with LUCIA and feels a twinge of confusion. No, he can't conjure fireballs but ever since his fellowship with Straud began, he's suspended his sense of disbelief. Anything is possible... unless of course, it's not.</i>

<i>Behind him, he hears a bat's characteristic squeak. MANDARC, too, takes his human form. He wears his fur-lined jacket CEDRIC associates with his stay at the Straud Mansion.</i>

<i>They have been standing there only a minute when a dog begins to bark.</i>

<i>MANDARC's eyes widen.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> SHE HAS... A DOG?

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH -- YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

<I>The door opens before they have a chance to knock. ROXANNE SCHWARTZ stands there, looking haggard and tired.</i>

### ROXANNE ###

> COME IN.

<I>The dog approaches the men as they enter the house and begins to give them a vigorous sniff-down. His tail swings back and forth at an uneven tempo as he encounters the foreign scents.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> HEY BOY...

<I>MANDARC bends down to pet the dog, kneeling cautiously. The worries of his nightmare seem to melt away as he sinks his fingers into the dog's waxy fur.</i>

### ROXANNE ###

> THIS IS EDWARD. HE'S SOME KIND OF POODLE MUTT.

<I>MANDARC continues to pet the dog.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> YOU'RE A GOOD BOY, AREN'T YOU? 

<I>EDWARD licks MANDARC's face.</i>

### ROXANNE ###

> HAH, YEAH, HE DOES THAT. SORRY.

### MANDARC ###

> (between lickings) OH, IT'S OKAY. I...

<I>CEDRIC interrupts.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> MANDARC'S EX STOLE HIS DOG.

### ROXANNE ###

> WHAT?! THAT'S LOW.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. IT IS.

> SHE'S NOT WELCOME IN OUR CIRCLE ANYMORE.

<I>MANDARC is still kneeling.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> (to the dog) HIS NAME WAS DEXX. IS DEXX. A SKINNY MUTT. NOT FUZZY LIKE YOU ARE. WHAT A COAT!

<I>There is a moment where the group feels warmed by the comraderie between MANDARC, EDWARD.</I>

<i>MANDARC stands, trying to pull his attention from the dog. But EDWARD won't have it and keeps seeking affection.</i>

<I>CEDRIC almost smiles.</i>

### CEDRIC ### 

> WELL THE SECRET TO THE (w)INTRANET IS PRETTY SIMPLE ONCE WE GET GOING. WHERE'S YOUR COMPUTER?

### ROXANNE ###

> UPSTAIRS.

> I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO HARD, NEVER BEEN ONE FOR COMPUTERS.

<I>The group go upstairs. A number of cobwebs dot the upper corners of the room. How long has Roxanne lived here?</i>

<i>CEDRIC inserts a USB stick into the computer and boots from it. He opens up the desktop folders and introduces her to a number of background utilities that perform various tasks, including masking IP, taking over the host computer, and lastly, accessing the social boards.</i>

<i>He looks around the desk. The computer is a mix of old and new.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> YOU GOT A WEBCAM?

> WE USUALLY USE FACIAL RECOGNITION FOR BASIC SOCIALS.

### ROXANNE ### 

> NO... NEVER NEEDED ONE.

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL, WE'LL GET YOU HOOKED UP.

> THIS ONE CAN BE YOU FOR NOW.

> GO AHEAD, SEND A PUBLIC MESSAGE LETTING EVERYONE KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/00-026.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ROXANNE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Hi everyone</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> MESSAGES HERE ARE SENT IN REAL TIME, SOMETIMES YOU'LL HEAR IMMEDIATELY, SOMETIMES YOU WON'T.

> SOME OF US HAVE ACCESS THROUGH OUR PHONES, BUT IT'S A CERTAIN SECURITY RISK SO I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE ADDITIONAL ACCESS IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

### ROXANNE ###

> MAKES SENSE.

### CEDRIC ###

> THESE BOARDS ARE STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I'M NOT EXACTLY A MASTER PROGRAMMER SO I'M ALWAYS MAKING IMPROVEMENTS.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-txtinc.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Nice to see you, Roxanne.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ### 

> OF COURSE THERE'S A FACE YOU RECOGNIZE.

> I'LL SEND A MESSAGE AS WELL SO YOU CAN SEE THE TIME DELAY.

<I>CEDRIC removes his cellphone from his pocket and begins typing intently.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric-txtinc.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Welcome to the fold.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> NOW JUST BE MINDFUL THAT ANYTHING CAN BE COMPROMISED AND NOTHING IS SAFE. THINK OF IT LIKE A TELEGRAM SYSTEM. WHO KNOWS WHO MIGHT READ YOUR MESSAGE IN THE MIDDLE.

> I TRY TO KEEP IT SAFE, AND THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER, BUT...

> IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO EVICT MANDARC'S EX.

> AND SHE WAS USING SOME PROGRAMS OF HER OWN TO DISGUISE HER LURKING, OR SO I SUSPECT.

> TRY NOT TO USE IT ON A PUBLIC COMPUTER UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

> BESIDES, THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE COMING UP BEHIND YOU AND SPYING OVER YOUR SHOULDER.

<I>At this point, CEDRIC, ROXANNE are alone in the room. MANDARC has left to lavish more attention upon EDWARD.</I>
