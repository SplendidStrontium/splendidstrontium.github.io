### // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<BR><I>There are eyes watching me as I come to consciousness. Too many eyes. I sit up.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
> 
> MYRTLE?

#### MYRTLE

> YOU'RE AT THE SCHOOL, CEDRIC.
> 
> YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

#### VINCENT

> SAFE?
> 
> YOU THINK HE'S SAFE?
> 
> THE USE OF THAT SCROLL DETONATED A SHOW OF WILD MAGIC THE WORLD'S NOT SEEN IN --

#### MYRTLE

> BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

<BR><I>I did not relish being watched like this. Always with the eyes. I despised the eyes.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I'D LIKE A DRINK OF WATER.

<BR><I>She turned toward her son, standing sheepishly behind.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> KEVIN, COULD YOU GET HIM A GLASS OF WATER?

<BR><I>I had no qualms with the Headmistress' teenaged son, not outside the fact that he belonged to this crazy-ass school. What I did take issue with, however, was the rumor I'd heard that he'd been kept locked in a room for the entirety of his childhood years.</i>

<i>No claim to unknown magicks would dissuade me from the foul taste in my mouth.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> THAT'S FINE; I CAN GET IT MYSELF.

<BR><I>I try to make a familiar gesture but my limbs feel thick, heavy, useless.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> CEDRIC...YOUR TALENT...

<BR><I>I try again. But as if moving my hands through cold water, I'm weak.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> PLEASE DON'T OVEREXERT YOURSELF.

#### CEDRIC

> OVEREXERT MYSELF?
> 
> I JUST WANT A DAMN GLASS OF WATER!

#### MYRTLE

> IT MIGHT BE...OVER FOR YOU.

<BR><I>Rage bubbles to the surface. What could she know about my power?</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT THE FUCK DID SHE DO TO ME?

#### MYRTLE

> SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

#### MYRTLE

> HERMIONE TOLD ME.
> 
> I'M GLAD SHE DID OR WE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT TO YOU IN TIME.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME.
> 
> FIRST SHE HIT ME WITH HER CAR, NOW SHE'S TAKEN MY MAGIC FROM ME?
> 
> WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE?

#### VINCENT

> YOU NEED OUR PROTECTION.

#### CEDRIC

> LIKE HELL I DO.
> 
> ALL THAT I'VE GOT SINCE COMING TO THIS PLACE...

<BR><I>I'd never been as capable as the Orphans that'd been here since their youth, but now...Was it really gone? All of it, gone?</i>

<i>The two of them stare at me in what can only be pity. Kevin seems to be hiding his eyes.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> LET ME GO HOME.

<BR><I>But Vincent speaks with an edge of impatience, like I'd heard him use toward me in my apartment.</i>

#### VINCENT

> THE ENEMY IS AFTER YOU, CEDRIC.
> 
> YOU'VE BECOME...SOMETHING MORE THAN A MAGE.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'RE GOING TO PUNISH THEM, RIGHT?
> 
> LARRY AND HIS LITTLE BUDDY WERE THERE, DRUNK AS FUCKING SKUNKS.

#### MYRTLE

> EACH IN THEIR OWN TIME.
> 
> RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> ME?
> 
> I'M JUST FINE.
> 
> YOU KNOW, BESIDES LOSING MY LIFE AND MY TALENT ALL IN ONE NIGHT.
> 
> I'M JUST PEACHY.

#### MYRTLE

> THE SCROLLS WERE CREATED BY THE FIRST ONE.
> 
> IT WAS SAID SHE AIMED TO CREATE AGELESS, DEATHLESS SOLDIERS TO GUARD HER CREATIONS.
> 
> YOU'RE...IMMORTAL, CEDRIC.

#### CEDRIC

> I WAS IMMORTAL BEFORE.

#### MYRTLE

> NOT WITHOUT YOUR POTION YOU WEREN'T.
> 
> BUT YOU HAVE NO NEED OF ANY OF THAT NONSENSE ANYMORE.

#### CEDRIC

> CAN EVERYONE JUST GIVE ME SOME GODDAMNED SPACE?
> 
> WHERE AM I?

#### VINCENT

> THIS IS MY LAIR, CEDRIC.
> 
> I AM A VAMPIRE. LIKE KEVIN. LIKE YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> NOT LIKE ME.

#### VINCENT

> YES LIKE YOU.
> 
> YOU'VE CROSSED OVER.
> 
> IF YOU ACQUIESE TO OUR OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP --

#### CEDRIC

> FRIENDSHIP?
> 
> I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE EVER SINCE I CAME TO THIS GOD-FORSAKEN HOVEL.

<BR><I>I hoped the Headmistress would take offense. I hoped they all would take offense. I was at their mercy and I hated it.</i>

#### VINCENT

> MY SON HAS RECENTLY BEGUN TO SUFFER THE CURSE.
> 
> I THINK THERE'S MUCH YOU CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.

<BR><I>No, I didn't begrudge Kevin. But I hadn't known that he was a...</i>

#### MYRTLE

> IF I HAD KNOWN, CEDRIC...
> 
> I'M SO SORRY.

#### CEDRIC

> THIS IS BULLSHIT. 
> 
> THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT.

<BR><I>I look at the eyes of the three Marscapones all staring at me. I run my fingers through my hair anxiously.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> CAN I HAVE THAT DRINK NOW?

#### MYRTLE

> KEVIN, CAN YOU GET CEDRIC --

#### CEDRIC

> I DIDN'T MEAN HIM. 
> 
> I'LL GET IT MYSELF.

<BR><I>So this was the secret hidden on the lower level. I'd fled Uhaigha so I could find myself at the mercy of the undead.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOU'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT WHAT THIS SCHOOL IS.

#### MYRTLE

> NOTHING HAS TO CHANGE.

#### VINCENT

> DON'T FILL HIS HEAD WITH PLATITUDES.
> 
> EVERYTHING IS CHANGED NOW.

#### CEDRIC

> WAS THIS YOUR GOAL ALL ALONG, TO BRING VICTIMS TO YOUR...
> 
> YOUR...

#### MYRTLE

> IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

#### CEDRIC

> AND WHAT ABOUT HIM?

<BR><I>I point at Kevin.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HE'S JUST A CHILD!

#### MYRTLE

> THAT IS OUR CROSS TO BEAR.

<BR><I>At second glance, Kevin seemed older than he had before. In the shadows of the dark room, I could swear I saw grey fade upward into his crown. But it couldn't be -- he was supposed to be sixteen.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> JUST THINK BACK TO WHEN YOU FIRST WORKED MAGIC.
> 
> YOU MADE A LEAP OF FAITH.
> 
> A TREMENDOUS LEAP OF FAITH.
> 
> I JUST NEED YOU TO MAKE ONE MORE JUMP.

#### CEDRIC

> ONE MORE? 
> 
> WHERE DOES IT END?

#### VINCENT

> IT ENDS WHEN OUR FOES ARE VANQUISHED.

<BR><I>His wife gestures to dismiss his commentary.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> ENOUGH, VINCENT.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, STAY HERE AND BECOME A GUEST LECTURER ON THE FINER POINTS OF PARASITISM?

#### VINCENT

> YOU'LL JOIN OUR FAMILY.

#### MYRTLE

> ENOUGH, VINCENT. 
> 
> YOU'RE SCARING THE BOY.

<BR><I>Kevin returns with my glass of water. I take it greedily and down the liquid without so much as a breath between.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO RETURN TO?
> 
> DEALING DRUGS AND FLIRTING WITH HOUSEWIVES?

#### CEDRIC

> FUCK YOU TOO, OLD MAN.

#### MYRTLE

> CEDRIC, PLEASE.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU TOO!
> 
> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEPT THIS FROM ME!
> 
> FROM ALL YOUR STUDENTS.
> 
> DID YOU KILL HIM, TOO?

#### MYRTLE

> KEVIN IS NATURAL. 
> 
> BIOLOG--

#### CEDRIC

> THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL ABOUT THE WAKING DEAD!
> 
> I SUPPOSE THE OTHER --

#### VINCENT

> THE OTHER IS GEORGE HENRY.
> 
> ONE OF MY ACOLYTES.

#### CEDRIC

> ONE OF YOUR PRISONERS.

#### VINCENT

> NO ONE HERE IS A PRISONER.
> 
> WE FIGHT TO PRESERVE THIS WORLD FROM THOSE THAT WOULD SEEK TO DESTROY IT.

#### CEDRIC

> THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOODLY VAMPIRE.

#### VINCENT

> PERHAPS YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND AS YOU SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH US.

#### CEDRIC

> I CAN MAKE IT JUST FINE ON MY OWN, THANKS.

<BR><I>I put my glass down on a nearby dresser. </i>

<i>Fat lot I care about water stains.</i>

#### VINCENT

> I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE, CEDRIC.

<BR><I>As I step forward to try to leave he steps forward to block me. In those sunken eyes, I see the gaze of the wolf and I fear.</i>

#### VINCENT

> DON'T MAKE ME RESTRAIN YOU AGAIN.
> 
> I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU A PRISONER BUT I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE TO TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND OUT OF THE ENEMY'S HAND.

<BR><I>I stare at him, trying to focus on my body as if to keep its integrity.</i>

#### VINCENT

> YOU ARE THE DAYWALKER.
> 
> MAY THE GODS TAKE PITY ON OUR PATHETIC SOULS.

<BR>
