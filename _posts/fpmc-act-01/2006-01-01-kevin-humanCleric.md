### // MARSCAPONE APARTMENTS // 

<br><i>The two recollect at the apartment after taking the evening's sustenance. Holidays were easy; people were still pliable and jolly in the freshly turned year.</i>

<i>But regardless of how easy the hunt had been, it was good to return to the basement apartment where they could at least pretend for a few moments that they were no different from any other inhabitant of Earth.</i>

<i>When KEVIN returns, CEDRIC is already waiting. They don't speak of the past, they don't speak of what it is to need, to require. They keep looking forward.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> WE DOIN' THIS THING?

<br><I>CEDRIC doesn't tear his attention from the computer.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT THING.

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> REROLLING WITH SVETLANA.

<BR><I>He looks up.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WE ACTUALLY DOING THAT?

#### KEVIN

> YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

#### CEDRIC

> THIS GONNA BE SOME ONE-OFF, OR WHAT?
> 
> I'M NOT SO EXCITED ABOUT ABANDONING ALL THE WORK I'VE PUT INTO THARGORE.

<BR><I>KEVIN, CEDRIC had been playing since the launch of the game some year ago.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WELL, YOU'RE KIND OF STUCK WITH HER, RIGHT?

#### CEDRIC

> DON'T REMIND ME.

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THAT BAD.
> 
> YOU'RE BLOWING THINGS OUT OF PROPORTION.
> 
> SHE'S NICE.

#### CEDRIC

> OH, SHE'S NICE ENOUGH.
> 
> INSANE.

#### KEVIN

> I THINK THE RUMORS HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED. 
> 
> EVERYONE GETS ALL WEIRD WHEN THEY HEAR OF SOMEONE STARTING TO SLIP.
> 
> SHE SEEMED DOWNRIGHT CIVILIZED TO ME.

<br><i>Vampires, like all humanoids, existed on a continuum of sanity. Some of their kind had let the thirst overwhelm them their minds and they wandered the wilderness hunting indiscriminately, becoming the stuff of tavern tales.</i> 

<I>KEVIN lowers his voice as if to deliver an aside.</i>

#### KEVIN

> (quietly) If more knew about me...

<br><i>CEDRIC raises his voice, contesting the self-deprecating commentary.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> DON'T EVEN GET STARTED ON THIS BULLSHIT.
> 
> YOU'RE NOT LOST.

<BR><I>KEVIN had been having difficulty accepting the fact that he seemed to be able to talk to his deceased father in the recesses of his mind. In his darker moments, he dismissed it at schizophrenia. But he had confided in CEDRIC, who fully believed in the mystery of the departed.</i>

<I>He did not, however, believe in schizophrenia.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'RE NOT LOST, KEV.

#### KEVIN

> (quietly) Yeah... I guess.

<br><i>SVETLANA seemed isolated, happy to have the company. She wasn't over-eager or strange, certainly not crazy. He pitied her for the miasma of rumor she seemed to have attracted. Gossip was a common affliction of their kind, often seeded from jealousy.</i>

<br><i>At the recognition of his father's voice, KEVIN is suddenly very aware of the divide between himself and the digital realm. The game feels distant, polygons and bright textures jarring and irritating.</i>

<i>CEDRIC is absorbed in the computer screen, none-the-wiser, scrolling through character customization options.</i>

<center>[ CLIK. ]</center>
<center>[ CLIK CLIK CLIK...]</center>

<br><i>CEDRIC continues to click through his customization options. KEVIN reflects, that he, too, will end up making the same character he's already got.</i>

<i>Was it true that he'd prefer to play an RPG?</i>

<i>It wasn't true for himself. No, he never lost himself enough. It was always a chance for his mind to seat itself in doubt and shame. His mood would become mired in doom and gloom, and it was always a task to muck himself out into the light again.</i>
