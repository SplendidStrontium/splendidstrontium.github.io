## // OLD GOTH ESTATE // ##

<i>CASSANDRA GOTH has suffered an exhausting year. Last summer, her mother died of a mysterious illness that struck her quickly and completely. Her husband left the family parentless just a month later, leaving a pained message to his son that he could no longer continue on. Her younger brother left the city to move in with a family friend of their father's.</i>

<i>Sometimes the whole thing seems incomprehensible in its scope. Just a year ago, her parents were alive and the four of them celebrating her new job at FutureSim.</i>

<i>Today she is at home with a cold.</i>

<i>She's watching videos on her phone when it buzzes with a phone number she hasn't seen in quite some time.</i>

<i>The preview is bold and alights the spirit of defiance.</i>

</div>

<i>The last time she'd talked to her co-worker, she had mentioned her worry that the receptionist had stopped showing up to work.</i>

*****

### CASSANDRA ###

> WE WEREN'T SUPER CLOSE... BUT I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF HE WERE GONNA QUIT.

### KEVIN ###

> SIMEON AND I WEREN'T FRIENDS. 

> BUT I WILL LOOK INTO IT.

### CASSANDRA ###

> I DON'T THINK HE WOULDA QUIT. I DON'T KNOW. SEEMS OUT OF CHARACTER.

> MAYBE HE'S JUST SICK?

> IF YOU COULD JUST SEND ME HIS ADDRESS?

<i>CASSANDRA closes the video player and opens up her text messaging client.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA is silent. She stares at the words, acutely aware of the empty house. She has been resistant to believing any of what she's seen could be true. Resistant to believe what she once thought she'd dreamt as a child -- that her mother was ... a witch.</i>

<i>It proves her childish claim correct. But it also means her mother was something special. And special in a way that she herself was not.</i>

</div>

<i>Just this past November, when the young 'princess' had invaded her home, CASSANDRA had been witness to KEVIN's elderly mother MYRTLE conjure a prison of ice, immobilizing the woman. It was something she couldn't explain, and she'd been trying desperately to put it out of mind.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">I don't know.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But the trait was enough that she tried to hide it.</p>

### CASSANDRA ###

> (thinking) Why me? Why would she hide this from me?

<p class="ppl-sez">My mother was acquainted with your grandmother.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">If you want, I could tell her contact you. If you want to know more.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The sensitivity to leylines is commonly passed from mother to daughter.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That isn't to say there aren't exceptions.</p>

<i>Despite plain-text, the conversation seems to hang, awkwardly, with words unsaid.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't know why you aren't able to work magic. Maybe it's as simple as a lack of training. There is always the possibility.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But regardless of whether you are able to work the mystery, you still carry your family's history within you. And that's why I believe FutureSim is no longer safe for you.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">And to be honest, it was probably your bloodline that earned you the spot.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">They're nothing.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But their patron is someone -- something -- far larger.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">We can't trust anyone.</p>

<i>The timestamp flashes as CASSANDRA pauses to scroll again through the conversation.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA stares at the words she's sent, waiting longer than she wished for a response.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They hollowed me out a long time ago. They took all the information on me that they could.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But the technology wasn't there yet.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-inctbeyes.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Your grandmother protects you even now.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stay.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Heal.</p>
</div>

<i>Soon, the messages stop populating. CASSANDRA is thankful, yearning for silence.</i>

<i>She yearns to sleep, to wake up in a world she thought she knew.</i>

<i>All she had wanted to hear was the news that SIMEON, too, was simply ill.</i>
