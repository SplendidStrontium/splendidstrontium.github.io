### // THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<br><i>It is night when we arrive back at the school.</i>

#### VINCENT

> THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE.

#### STRAUD 

> IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.

<BR><I>We enter through the basement apartment.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> WHERE WAS THE LAST PLACE YOU THINK HE MADE AN IMPRESSION?

<BR><I>The sound of footsteps comes from above our heads. It's Myrtle, making her descent. She opens the landing door and lays eyes on her husband, Vincent Marscapone and Count Vladislaus Straud IV.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> COUNT.
> 
> WELCOME.

<BR><I>The Count bows deeply.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> MRS. MARSCAPONE.
> 
> I'M SORRY MY VISIT MUST BE UNDER SUCH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCE.

#### MYRTLE 

> NO...
> 
> I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

#### STRAUD 

> WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE BOY'S DISAPPEARANCE?

#### MYRTLE 

> THE DOORS WERE LEFT OPEN.

#### STRAUD 

> WHICH DOORS?

#### MYRTLE 

> THE FRONT DOOR WAS CRACKED, AS WAS HIS BEDROOM DOOR.

#### STRAUD 

> WAS ANYTHING ELSE DISTURBED?

#### MYRTLE 

> I DON'T THINK SO BUT IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY.

#### STRAUD 

> TAKE ME UPSTAIRS.

<BR><I>The three of us walk upstairs to where Kevin's bedroom flanks his mother's.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> THIS IS WHERE THE BOY'S BEDROOM IS?

#### MYRTLE 

> YES, IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE --

#### STRAUD 

> I DON'T NEED TO GO THERE, JUST...

<BR><I>We go silent, listening. Candles cast an amber glow over the quiet.</i>

<I>He steps over to a nearby table with a number of focusing crystals laid out for viewing.</i> 

#### STRAUD 

> THESE CRYSTALS. HE WAS SORTING THROUGH THEM.

<br><i>All attention goes to Straud as a supernatural chasm seems to ripple through our consciousnesses.</i>

<i>It is the sound of a silver bell.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> THE DOORBELL.
> 
> KEVIN HEARD THE SOUND OF THE DOORBELL.
> 
> AND HE ANSWERED IT.

<BR>
