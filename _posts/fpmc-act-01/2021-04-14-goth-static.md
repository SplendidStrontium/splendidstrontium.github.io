## // OLD GALANTOME ESTATE // ##

<br><i>CASSANDRA GOTH has suffered an exhausting year. Last summer, her mother died of a mysterious illness that struck her quickly and completely. Her husband left the family parentless just a month later, leaving a pained message to his son that he could no longer continue on. Her younger brother left the city to move in with a family friend of their father's.</i>

<i>Sometimes the whole thing seems incomprehensible in its scope. Just a year ago, her parents were alive.</i>

<i>Today she is at home with a cold.</i>

<i>She's watching videos on her phone when it buzzes with a phone number she hasn't seen in quite some time.</i>

<i>The preview is bold and alights the spirit of defiance.</i>

<br><i>CASSANDRA is silent. She stares at the words, acutely aware of the empty house. She has been resistant to believing any of what she's seen could be true. Resistant to believe what she once thought she'd dreamt as a child -- that her mother was ... a witch.</i>

<i>It proves her childish claim correct. But it also means her mother was something special. And special in a way that she herself was not.</i>
