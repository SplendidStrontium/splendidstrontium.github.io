<I>When CEDRIC gets home, it's late.</i>

<i>AVAEL has forgotten to feed the cat. Again. The cat near explodes at him when he walks in the door. He dumps some kibble in the bowl and moves on with his day.</i>

<i>He's just about to sit down to enjoy a little time with a book when -- </i>

<center>BZZ!!</center>

<i>His phone starts going off.</i>

<i>It's the half-breed.</i>

<i>CEDRIC puts down his phone. Of course CALEB was always... wincing.</i>

<i>He yells into the house.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> AVAEL! CALEB WANTS TO COME OVER TONIGHT!

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm not sure we have room around the table.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> HE WON'T PLAY. YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.

> SUPERSTITIOUS.

> HIS FATHER WAS A RELIGIOUS FREAK.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yes, the Elder Vatore did not teach his children much of our lore. A pity, really.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> JUST LEFT IT TO US TO DO. WHAT A DICK.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yes, what a dick.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> ANYWAY THE DUDES ARE ALL COMING OVER TONIGHT.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That is good to hear. Will Mandarc be in attendance?</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> I ASSUME SO.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That is good. It is good for the young man to get out of the house.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. MAYBE SOMEDAY HE WON'T BE SUCH A TWAT.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">'Twat'? Please elaborate.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> A TWAT. LIKE... UH... YOU KNOW. AN ANNOYING PERSON. ONE THAT JUST KIND OF SPOILS ANY PARTY HE'S A PART OF. MAKES SOCIALIZING DIFFICULT. RUINS THE FLOW OF CONVERSATION.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A wet blanket.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> SORT OF. BUT LESS SAD.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I always thought the company felt that way about George Henry.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL G.H. COMES ALIVE AT THE TABLE SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE HIM AROUND. 

> YOU KNOW, EVERY GROUP NEEDS THAT GUY TO PLAY THE RANGER OR WHATEVER.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">So your issue with Mandarc is his character class?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Perhaps I should advise him to stop min-maxing.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

> HE'S JUST ALWAYS SO... SELF-CENTERED.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I would blame that on his lonely childhood.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH WELL I WAS AN ONLY CHILD TOO.

> WELL. SORT OF.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm sure that as the campaign progresses, each player will find their day to shine. It just helps to read the Player's Manual.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH THAT'S MY OTHER ISSUE WITH MANDARC.

> HE'S ALWAYS WANTING TO CHANGE HIS CHARACTER.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Perhaps you should collect their sheets at the end of the session.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH THAT MIGHT HELP FOR A BIT BUT KNOWING HIM HE'S JUST GONNA ASK FOR A FACSIMILE.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A 'facsimile'?</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S A FANCY WORD FOR COPY. HE'S JUST GONNA ASK ME TO RUN HIS CHARACTER SHEET ON THE XEROX AND TAKE THAT HOME WITH HIM TO PLAN HIS AMENDMENTS.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But, you would have a record of his inventory, at the very least.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT THE PART I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

> HE'S ALWAYS... UGH.

> YOU KNOW. WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

> PROBABLY DOESN'T HELP MYSELF TO JUST BROOD OVER ALL THE ANNOYING CRAP HE DOES. WE'RE STUCK WITH HIM.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Indeed. The Master has the aim to reform the former follower of Doctor McCoy.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> A NOBLE AIM. IF A BIT... BOLD.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The Master always seemed a bit italic to me.</p>
</div>

### CEDRIC ###

> NOW, THERE'S A JOKE! YOU'RE STARTING TO GET THIS, AVAEL!

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Thank you, sir. I try.</p>

<i>When CALEB arrives at the auxiliary apartments, he brings a heaping basket of bright lavender fruit.</i>

<i>Plasma fruit. From his father's store.</i>

### CALEB ###

> I BROUGHT ONLY THE BEST.

### CEDRIC ###

> WE SHALL SEE. YOUR GARDENER LEAVES A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED.

### CALEB ###

> WELL I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES. MY FAMILY IS WITHERING.

### CEDRIC ###

> IF ONLY YOU'D MAKE UP WITH YOUR SISTER.

### CALEB ###

> MY SISTER? LIKE SHE'D BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THE GARDEN. SHE MIGHT BREAK A NAIL.

### CEDRIC ###

> EH. I GUESS.

### CALEB ###

> ANYWAY SIERRA HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

### CEDRIC ###

> NEVER HAD KIDS OF HER OWN, EH?

### CALEB ###

> DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY.

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL, SHE'LL BE AROUND TO CARE FOR YOURS, RIGHT?

### CALEB ###

> BUH? SAY WHAT?

### CEDRIC ###

> KIDS. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN COURTING THE MOON PRIESTESS, IS IT NOT?

### CALEB ###

> I THINK WE'RE GETTING A BIT AHEAD OF OURSELVES, AREN'T WE?

### CEDRIC ###

> NEVER TOO EARLY TO START PLANNING.

### CALEB ###

> UH. WELL. ANYWAY. YOU WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I'VE GOT?

### CEDRIC ### 

> ... YEAH. SURE.

<I>CALEB sits the basket upon the counter. CEDRIC walks over and selects the first plum-like produce on the pile.</i>

<i>He looks it over. It's... what is it like?</i>

<i>CEDRIC lifts it to his nose and gives it a great sniff.</i>

<i>It smells... heavy. Boozy.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> DIS ALL YOU GOT?

<I>CALEB seems to sink in shame. Shocked. Embarrassed.</i>

### CALEB ###

> WELL... THAT ONE IS... ONE OF THE BEST...

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, CALEB. YOU BEEN CUTTING THIS STUFF?

### CALEB ###

> CUTTING? LORD, NO, I WOULD NEVER!

### CEDRIC ###

> I'M SURE YOU WOULD FOR YOUR LESS... DISCERNING CUSTOMERS.

### CALEB ###

> WHAT?! NO!

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL, LET'S SEE HOW IT MIXES UP THEN.

### CALEB ###

> MIXES, SIR?

### CEDRIC ###

> YES, CALEB. I LIKE TO DO A BIT OF A TITRATION TEST.

<I>CALEB gulps.</i>

### CALEB ###

> A... TITRATION?

> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE FED EARLIER SO MY BLADDER IS A BIT FULL...

### CEDRIC ###

> OH. WHAT A PITY.

### CALEB ###

> WELL -- I'M SURE I CAN MAKE A LITTLE SPACE.

### CEDRIC ###

> YES. IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO BUY, I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND IT IN YOURSELF TO PARTICIPATE IN MY TASTE TEST.

### CALEB ###

> YES.... YES.

<I>CEDRIC prepares the plasma jane.</i>

<i>CEDRIC tries to make some light conversation.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> SO I HEARD YOUR FATHER NEVER TAUGHT YOU HOW TO DRINK BLOOD.

### CALEB ###

> (shocked) WHAT?! WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

### CEDRIC ###

> YOUR SISTER IS A BLABBERMOUTH.

### CALEB ###

> GEEZ. UH. WELL.

### CEDRIC ###

> SO, IT'S TRUE THEN.

### CALEB ###

> YOU REALLY PULL NO PUNCHES. CAN'T YOU CUT ME A BREAK FOR MY PARENTAGE?

### CEDRIC ###

> SORRY. LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO KEEP LIES.

### CALEB ###

> SO SAYS YOU.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH DICKBAG. SO SAYS ME.

### CALEB ###

> YEAH. IT'S TRUE. MY FATHER PREACHED THE GOSPEL OF VEGETARIANISM.

### CEDRIC ###

> VEGETARIANISM. BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE.

### CALEB ###

> HE CULTIVATED THE FRUIT SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO CAUSE THE MORTALS UNDUE SUFFERING.

### CEDRIC ###

> WHAT -- THEY MISS A DAY OF WORK OR SOMETHING? OH NO -- DEAR LORD.

### CALEB ###

> IT CAUSES STRESS UPON THE SYSTEMS, YOU KNOW. THE MARROW HAS TO WORK OVERTIME TO REPLACE WHAT WE DRAIN FROM THEM.

### CEDRIC ###

> AND?

### CALEB ###

> AND... UH...

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, CALEB. YOU HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH THE RHETORIC YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT. 

> PERHAPS YOU OUGHT TO REVERSE YOURSELF IN HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY.

> SO. YOU GONNA TRY THIS SHIT WITH ME, OR WHAT.

### CALEB ###

> UH... YEAH. GIVE ME A HIT.

### CEDRIC ###

> AW. NOW. YOU DON'T WANT TO SMOKE IT HALFWISE.

> TAKE A FULL BITE.

<I>CALEB lifts the glass to his lips and the bright liquid trickles into the back of his throat.</i>

<i>CEDRIC samples his own.</i>

> WELL -- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

### CALEB ###

> IT'S... UH... TANGY.

### CEDRIC ###

> TANGY.

### CALEB ###

> YEAH, IT'S GOT A SMOOTH FINISH.

### CEDRIC ###

> GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

### CALEB ###

> IS THIS YOUR USUAL PREPARATION?

<I>CEDRIC says nothing, lowers his head and glares at him over the bottom of his eyes.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> A MIXOLOGIST NEVER REVEALS HIS SECRETS.

*****

<I>When CALEB finally leaves, shown as a shoddy peddler, he leaves the entire basket of fruit.</i>

<i>CEDRIC inspects each and every, but finds them all beneath his minimum required quality. Most of them are turning to mush and the ones that aren't are too hard to juice.</i>

### CEDRIC ### 

> JUNK. ALL OF IT.

<I>MANDARC comes downstairs.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> THIS IS WHAT YOU BOUGHT FROM VATORE?

### CEDRIC ###

> BOUGHT? YOU DISHONOR ME.

> THIS TRASH ISN'T WORTH THE BASKET IT'S CARRIED IN.

<I>MANDARC picks up one of the fruits. He inspects it.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> UGH, YEAH. 

<I>He recoils.</i>

> THIS ONE'S GOT MOLD ON IT.

### CEDRIC ###

> EEYEP. THE LITTLE GUY HAS NO EYE FOR HORTICULTURE.

### MANDARC ###

> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A HORTICULTURIST TO SEE THAT THIS SHIT IS BARELY FIT FOR THE FLIES.

### CEDRIC ###

> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYIN'.

<I>MANDARC sighs.</I>

### MANDARC ###

> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HIM?

> HE'S HOPELESS.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, I'LL SAY.

> I DON'T KNOW.

> I KNOW I TAKE ISSUE WITH HIS ATTEMPTED COURTSHIP WITH THE MOON PRIESTESS. DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT IS DOOMED TO FAIL?

### MANDARC ###

> SO SAYS THE --

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. YEAH. I DON'T NEED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT AGAIN.

### MANDARC ###

> WELL?

### CEDRIC ###

> LISTEN. I HAVE MY OWN INTERESTS. WEAKNESSES. ADDICTIONS. 

> I'LL DEAL WITH THEM IN MY OWN TIME.

> STILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT CALEB IS FLIRTING, HOPELESSLY, WITH A FOREIGN POWER.

> THAT CANNOT STAND.

### MANDARC ###

> YEAH. AND HIS SISTER IS WORKING ON QUARQ.

### CEDRIC ###

> I DON'T LIKE TO THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DETAILS.

### MANDARC ###

> AH, BUT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS.

### CEDRIC ###

> OH, SHUT UP MANDARC.

### MANDARC ###

> SORRY, JUST TROLLING YOU.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, THAT'S APPARENT.

### MANDARC ###

> ANYWAY. CALEB.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. CALEB. HIS FRUIT SUCKS.

### MANDARC ###

> TELL ME ABOUT IT.

> I'M NOT EVEN SO SURE WE SHOULD BE EATING THAT CRAP ANYWAY. THE MASTER SURELY DOESN'T.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH WELL HE CAN AFFORD TO GO OUT AFTER DARK.

### MANDARC ###

> WE'LL GET THERE.

### CEDRIC ###

> SURE. WHATEVER YOU SAY.

### MANDARC ###

> I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THE FRUIT, ANYWAY. REMINDED YOU OF OLD TIMES OR SOMETHING.

### CEDRIC ###

> I BEEN TRYIN' TO QUIT.

### MANDARC ###

> QUIT? EH. WE OUGHTA ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

> ONCE THE MORTALS FIGURE OUT HOW THE TREE IS SOURCED... IT'S BAD NEWS BEARS.

### CEDRIC ###

> THEY HAVE A SURPRISINGLY DEEP STOMACH FOR THE MACABRE.

### MANDARC ###

> YEAH, BUT THIS ONE'S GONNA HIT THEM RIGHT IN THE FEELS.

### CEDRIC ###

> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

### MANDARC ###

> THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS TIME THEY HAVE MASS MEDIA.

### CEDRIC ###

> SO WHAT. PEOPLES OF THE PAST HAD BETTER MEMORIES.

### MANDARC ###

> EH. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

### CEDRIC ###

> FINE. I SUSPECT THEY HAD BETTER MEMORIES.

### MANDARC ###

> ANYWAY. I DON'T CARE IF THE MASTER AND VATORE WERE FRIENDS, I'M SWEARING OFF THIS SHIT FRUIT.

### CEDRIC ###

> I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR BUT WE PROBABLY NEED TO FIND A NEW DEALER.

### MANDARC ###

> BUT WHO? IT'S NOT SAFE TO GO POSTING THAT STUFF ON THE PUBLIC FORA.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. I'M WELL-AWARE.

### MANDARC ###

> WE COULD ALWAYS TRY TO CULTIVATE IT OURSELVES.

### CEDRIC ###

> I'M NOT INTERESTED. NO TIME. THANKS.

### MANDARC ###

> WELL THE SHORTAGE MAY NOT CONCERN <U>YOU</U>, GOLDEN CHILD, BUT IT VERY MUCH CONCERNS ME. AND I'M SURE G.H. WOULD BENEFIT AS WELL.

### CEDRIC ###

> G.H. JUST NEEDS MORE TRAINING. HE'LL BE FINE.

### MANDARC ###

> IT'S, AGAIN, OF LITTLE CONCERN FOR YOU. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?

### CEDRIC ###

> I'LL WORK ON IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

> BESIDES, AS THE MASTER'S FAVORED PET, WHAT DO YOU WORRY FOR?

### MANDARC ###

> IT'S NOT ME I'M WORRIED ABOUT. IT'S EVERYONE ELSE.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, WHATEVER KIDDO. GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE.
