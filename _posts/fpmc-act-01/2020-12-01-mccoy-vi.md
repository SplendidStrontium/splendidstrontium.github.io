## // MARSCAPONE SR. RANCH // ##

<i>The home of MYRTLE MARSCAPONE stands darkened in the night. Two bats perch on the underside of the porch. In a puff of smoke, the pair materialize. TRENTE GAGARIN, the daughter of the CHAIRPERSON, stands next to LENARD McCOY.</i>

<i>McCOY sniffs the air. A nearby ashtray is cluttered with butts.</i>

### McCOY ###

> SMELL THAT? 

> THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHAT I SMELLED ON HIM THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM.

### TRENTE ###

> THE CIGARETTES? 

> YOU'RE OBSESSED.

### McCOY ###

> AND YOU CAN'T SMELL FOR SHIT.

> HE'S BEEN HERE. 

<I>He continues to smell the air, walking toward the door.</i>

### McCOY ###

> SO HAS THE TRAITOR AND THE HAG.

### TRENTE ###

> WELL SHE LIVES HERE, SO...

### McCOY ###

> (wincing) YOU REALLY CAN'T SMELL THAT?

### TRENTE ###

> WELL IF I STUCK MY FACE IN IT, SURE.

<I>It's a quiet night. Clouds threaten rain but withhold for the time behind. It's chilly.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> DOESN'T YOUR DOLL SMOKE?

<I>Irreverence seeps thick through her use of the diminuitive.</i>

### McCOY ###

> NOT THIS KIND OF TRASH.

> THE HAG BUYS THE CHEAPEST --

> WAIT.

> SHUT UP.

<I>A frown creeps over TRENTE's face. She's become accustomed to the mannerisms of the Doctor, but she despises being given commands.</i>

<i>He continues to sniff, trying to trail.</i>

### McCOY ###

> BESIDES. I'M WORKING ON THAT.

### TRENTE ###

> OH, BUBBLES, HUH? BECAUSE THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

<I>At this point, McCOY has stepped off the porch and into the side yard.</i>

### McCOY ###

> THE HAG HAS PROCURED A NEW CAULDRON. LOOK.

### TRENTE ###

> MUST I?

<I>McCOY continues to smell the air.</i>

### McCOY ###

> FRESHLY TURNED DIRT. THEY'VE TRIED TO COVER IT UP WITH FRESH SOD, BUT I CAN SMELL IT.

<I>He walks toward the wall of the house. On the ground is a small tombstone.</i>

<center>D.C. - A friend.</center>

### McCOY ###

> HERE HE IS.

<I>TRENTE cautiously weaves through the bushes, giving the cauldron a large berth. She stands next to McCOY and stares down at the black tombstone.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> 'A FRIEND'?

### McCOY ###

> CORONADO WAS ONE OF ...STRAUD'S. TWO TRAITORS HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

> MY OLD FRIEND HAS A THING FOR LIBRARIANS.

### TRENTE ###

> THEY'RE GETTING FEARFUL THEN, KILLING OFF THEIR OWN.

<I>McCOY is silent.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> LET THEM BE AFRAID. IT'S A WISDOM.

### McCOY ###

> I HAD HOPES FOR DUSTIN.

### TRENTE ###

> DIG FOR THE GLIMMERSTONE.

### McCOY ###

> WHAT?

### TRENTE ###

> THERE'S A SHATTERED GLIMMERSTONE HERE. 

### McCOY ###

> THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME. 

### TRENTE ###

> WHY WOULD THEY BURY HIM WITH A BROKEN GLIMMERSTONE?

<I>A dog barks and the two dissolve into a cloud of smoke, reappearing as bats that scatter off into the night.</i>
