### // THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<br><i>It is a Friday afternoon. I've promised to return to the school and give a lecture.</i>

<i>I must give my lecture in what functioned as the living room of the orphanage. Just a few walls away is the bedroom of Kevin Marscapone, now laying empty.</i>

<i>But the children do not know the boy is missing; the door is shut up tight like any other day at the Marscapone School of Magic.</i>

<i>Were he here, Kevin would be sitting quietly, listening to the lecture with rapt attention, desperate to make no sound.</i>

<i>I predict he would have succeeded.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>I point to a boy with eyes the color of aged silver.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOUR NAME, YOUNG MAN.

#### ELMER

> ELMER PARCELL.

#### STRAUD

> ELMER. 
> 
> I'M DOING A DEMONSTRATION ON LUNAR LIGHT TODAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE?
> 
> IT'S BY NO MEANS NECESSARY BUT I THINK IT WILL HELP YOUR CLASSMATES TO SEE THE FEAT WORKED FROM ONE OF THEIR OWN.

#### ELMER

> OF COURSE, SIR.
> 
> I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

<BR><I>My friend's wife, the woman Myrtle Marscapone, waits at the edge, supervising the gathering of her charges.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I KNOW A NUMBER OF YOU ARE WELL-ACCOMPLISHED IN SUMMONING LUNAR LIGHT BUT I ASK YOU PLEASE GIVE YOUR BEST ATTENTION TO THE COUNT VLADISLAUS STRAUD IV. 
> 
> YOU MAY VERY WELL LEARN SOMETHING.
> 
> NO EVOCATION IS EVER COMPLETE.
> 
> SOMETHING EACH OF YOU SHOULD KNOW AND UNDERSTAND FULLY.
> 
> YOUR WORK IS NEVER DONE.

<BR><I>A heavy sort of sobriety falls over the crowd.</i>

<i>I return my attention to the young man Elmer.</i>

#### STRAUD

> PLEASE COME UP HERE TO THE FRONT...THAT'S GOOD.
> 
> NOW PLEASE SUMMON YOUR LUNAR LIGHT FOR US.

<BR><I>The boy, now standing beside me, joins his two hands together, cupping them slightly and interlocking his fingers. He pulls his hands apart and in the created chasm is a small sphere of glowing light. It starts in overly bright in the small, dimly lit room, but dims and reveals its secrets.</i>

<i>It's an exact duplicate of the Earth's Moon, down to each crater. It is alight with a serene blueish glow.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WONDERFUL, CHILDREN. 
> 
> WE HAVE NOW JUST SEEN YOUR CLASSMATE CONJURE LUNAR LIGHT.
> 
> IT GLOWS WITH THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF YOUR OWN SUN.
> 
> A TRULY SPLENDID THING TO BEHOLD.

<br><i>A small hand shoots up to request an audience.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> YES, TZU?

<BR><I>Tzu is small for her age. Her black hair shines in the tiny Moon's glow.</i>

#### TZU

> WHAT IF THE EARTH HAD TWO MOONS? OR MORE?

<BR><I>It is a simple question that begs a response.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I SUPPOSE THAT THE SPELL WOULD SEE YOU SUMMON ONE OR MORE OF YOUR PLANET'S MOONS.
> 
> I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SPELL WORKED UNDER A PLANET WITH MULTIPLE MOONS.
> 
> BUT IF I WERE TO MAKE A CONJECTURE, I WOULD GUESS IT WOULD WORK ONE PLANETARY BODY AT A TIME.

#### TZU

> MAYBE IT WOULDN'T CHANGE BACK AND FORTH.
> 
> MAYBE YOU COULD ONLY SUMMON THE MOON UNDER WHICH YOU WERE BORN.

<BR><I>The students not watching Tzu are staring at Elmer's conjured Moon until he finally snuffs out the light, leaving the room feeling rather dark and empty.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THAT IS A PRESSING TOPIC YOU'VE TOUCHED UPON.
> 
> THE MATTER OF PREDESTINATION.
> 
> THE THINGS SURROUNDING THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF OUR BIRTH OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL.
> 
> SOME SPELLS WILL WORK THIS WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG.
> 
> BUT HOPEFULLY, IF YOU ARE CAUGHT ON SOME UNDESIRABLE SPELL EFFECT, YOU WILL GROW OUT OF IT WITH ENOUGH TIME.

#### TZU

> COULD YOU CONJURE LUNAR LIGHT FOR US?
> 
> PLEASE?

<BR><I>The whole of the students start to clamor and whisper in agreement. Even Myrtle has to hide her face in shame at their unabashed display of excitement.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I WILL GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE.
> 
> IF YOU ARE TO CONTINUE TO SUMMON AVATARS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES --
> 
> I SUGGEST YOU KEEP ON A GOOD RAPPORT WITH THEM.

<BR><I>Straud holds out his right hand while bowing slightly. He makes a gesture seeming to be a silent snap, and above his fingers appears so brilliant a sphere that it instantly forces the children to shield their eyes.</i>

<i>It's not a moon, it's the Sun.</i>

<i>Within a few seconds, the light calms itself but it is still a little too bright to stare directly at.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I HAVE WORKED ON THIS TRICK FOR MANY A YEAR.

<BR><I>The room is silent in awe for a good chunk of seconds.</i>

#### TZU

> HOW DOES ONE GET ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE SUN?

#### STRAUD

> WORSHIP.
> 
> HUMILITY.
> 
> DISCIPLINE.
> 
> THE MOON IS VERY DIFFERENT DEITY THAN THE SUN.
> 
> PERHAPS WE'LL USE THEIR NAMES. 
> 
> LUNA IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOL. SHE'LL SHOW HER FACE TO ANY WHO ASK, SO LONG AS YOU HAVEN'T PERSONALLY ANGERED HER.
> 
> SHE LOVES HER CHILDREN AND GIVES THEM THEIR FIRST TASTE OF FAITH.
> 
> IT IS NOT THAT SOL DOES NOT LOVE HIS CHILDREN, BUT THAT HE IS RETICENT TO GIVE OUT A SUNBEAM TO JUST ANYONE. HE NEEDS TRUST; A SUNBEAM CAN SMITE THE EYE AND HE DOES NOT TAKE KINDLY TO US USING HIS GLORY IN SUCH A WAY.
> 
> BUT A MOONBEAM DOESN'T HURT. NO, ONE CANNOT KILL WITH A MOONBEAM. 

#### ELMER

> DOES ONE HAVE TO WORSHIP THE SUN TO RECEIVE HIS BLESSING?

#### STRAUD

> I THINK WHAT YOU MEAN, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, IS WHETHER ONE MUST BE AN ACOLYTE OF THE SUN TO RECEIVE HIS BLESSING.
> 
> FOR WORSHIP, YES, ALL MUST WORSHIP THE SUN IF THEY ARE TO BE BLESSED BY HIM.
> 
> BUT NO, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE, AS YOU MIGHT THINK OF IT, MONOGAMOUS.
> 
> HE IS ALL-SEEING.

<BR><I>Straud releases his conjuration and the room quickly goes dark.</i>
