_NANNY-C originally created this note on November 14, 3913 at 12:00 AM._

Lost, corrupted, and otherwise unreadable data is nothing new. Some of the most tragic incidences of deletion without backup occured in the pre-modern era. I speak of book burnings; putting the flame to the written word.

Let this day be reserved to observe the solemn reality that some records will never be retrieved.

_Integrity of data. Transparency of records. Simplicity for man._
