_The following is set to the tune of "My Sharona" by the Knack._

Ooh my little Queenie bee, Banshee Queen
When ya gonna say it's yo time, Sylvanas?
Ooh you make the undead run, but be a hon
those golden val'kyr ain't thine, Sylvanas

Never gonna stop, blight it up, suck up all the life
One gaze in her eyes, and you'll see, she can hypnotize
M-m-m-my Sylvanas

Come a little closer, huh, a-will ya huh?
Close enough betrays all those dyes, Sylvanas
Won't ya let ya people be, let 'em free
Your kinda lovin' is a lie, Sylvanas

(refrain)

(instrumental)

When ya gonna give to me, dark Lady
Your pretty li'l head on a tine, Sylvanas?
Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny
Or is it that your coffin's guilt-lined, Sylvanas?

(refrain)

M-m-m-my Sylvanas...

(instrumental)

Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas
Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas
Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas
