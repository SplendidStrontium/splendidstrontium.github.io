It seems like Tamina has been around since the beginning of time. She is blonde (often worn in a braid) with grey, steely eyes. She wears a severe expression, telling of her disdain for the weak and lazy. Typical clothes are finely tailored - a loose flowing white blouse, red vest, dark grey pants and half cape. If appropriate, she may strap a fine shortsword to her belt.
