<i>I had a skit planned out with Cedric penned up at the hospital.</i>

<i>But was that really such a good idea?</i>

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>It's strange how certain sights, smells, sounds, stick out in our memories and refuse to let go.</i>

<i>No small part of Myrtle Marscapone was inspired by her. A quiet wisdom, secrets kept seething until descent into an unknown rage. What could she have been, a daughter of another age? Could she, would she, have lost herself in adventure? Sharp edges of modernity obscured behind seaswell and the smell of salt. Joy and loss of self. Welcome forgetfulness. Each sunrise a new beginning.</i>

<i>She was with me in the final judgement. She wanted to see me win against the odds. She wanted to see me win, to escape damnation. She had a special faith in me.</i>

<i>It's possible she warred against the Voice for longer than I can understand. Were we friends in the Void?</i>

## // QUEENS // ##

<i>In a sterile room sleeps the young man known to his friends as "CEDRIC D'IGGORY". He is yellow-haired and pale. His familiar uniform is nowhere to be seen; rather he has been garbed in a simply patterned hospital robe and light blue trousers. Tangled about his form is a stiff white topsheet. Under his head is a matching pillow. The pillow is so thin as to nearly be unnoticed. A bold sunset filters through the window.</i>

<i>CEDRIC, laying on his back, opens his eyes. Panic sets in immediately. These walls, this bed. It's not what he expected to see.</i>

<i>He sits up quickly. On his person, the hospital garment shifts, ballooning around his frame. In his view is an empty bed in front of him. The sheets are untidy, crumpled, suggesting occupancy.</i>

<i>He opens his mouth to speak but thinks better of it.</i>

<i>The doctor is painted carefully.</i>

### DR ###

<I>The nurse says nothing. Anxiety is welling up inside the young vampire. He says nothing, eyes moving between the two visitors. He's expending far more energy than he wants to.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

<i>It is labeled "FALL RISK".</I>

<I>He glares at it.</i>

<i>Pushing off from the side of the bed, CEDRIC lifts himself to his feet. Surprising, however, is that his body feels groggy, unsteady, heavy.</i>

<i>The doctor and the nurse back up to allow him space; both appear stunned at his feat.</i>

<I>CEDRIC sits back down.</i>

### DR ###

> GOODNIGHT, MR TAYLOR.

<I>The doctor and nurse turn their backs to him and he suddenly feels the regret of a lost game of poker. Cards played poorly.</i>

<i>Suddenly, a voice from the other side of the room erupts.</i>

### ROOMMATE ###

> ROOMIE? YOU FINALLY AWAKE?

<I>CEDRIC pauses for a moment, to recontre, recognize the gravely tone.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> UH... YEAH.

> I GUESS I AM.

### ROOMMATE ###

> YOU BEEN SLEEPWALKING OR SOMETHING, I DON'T EVEN KNOW. 

> THE WHOLE WARD IS A BUZZ ABOUT YOU.

<I>He was uncomfortable at the thought of the pseudo-celebrity status he had on this unknown playing field. He barely understood where, when, and why he was.

### CEDRIC ###

> THAT'S GREAT.

### ROOMMATE ###

> HAVEN'T TALKED TO NOBODY. KIND OF WEIRD.

> [pause]

> BUT YOU SEEM BETTER NOW. WHERE YOU FROM?

<I>CEDRIC feels irritation well up, suggesting a tightening of his fists, but he tries to relax. If all signs are true, there's no telling how long he'll be here. He makes an attempt at diplomacy.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> I... I DON'T REMEMBER.

### ROOMMATE ###

> AW MAN. YOU GOT YOURSELF SOME AMNESIA, HUH?

> I THOUGHT THAT ONLY HAPPENED IN THE MOVIES. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT FULLY AWAKE.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.

> I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD KNOW, BUT I DON'T.

### ROOMMATE ###

> YOU GOT A NAME?

### CEDRIC ###

> LOGAN TAYLOR.

### ROOMMATE ###

> I'M RANDALL.

### CEDRIC ###

> "RANDALL".

### RANDALL ###

> YOU CAN CALL ME "RANDY" IF YOU LIKE. DON'T BOTHER ME.

> [pause]

> SO HOW'S COME YOU CAN REMEMBER YOUR NAME BUT NOT WHERE YOU COME FROM?

### CEDRIC ###

> I DON'T KNOW.

<I>A sudden burst of embarrassment wells up inside him. A voice of encouragement tries to calm him.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> I DON'T KNOW -- I --

<I>He lifts himself from his bed and hastily makes his way toward the exit.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> I GOTTA TAKE A WALK.

<I>His body is heavy, tired. But sleep will provide little relief. What he wants, he cannot have.</i>

<i>The hallway is sufficiently lit. At the end of the passage, to his right, is a window. It is almost possible to miss the window with the high level of artificial lighting. Outside, the sky dims. From the left comes the buzz of a common area.</i>

<i>The noise is muted, indistinct. It's possible there is a movie playing but it's too difficult to tell from here.</i>

<i>Panic continues to set in. How did he get here? How did he lose his sense-of-self? His higher order thinking? The loyalty to his friends? The feeling of shame fills him and covers his heart. There's nothing to do but walk.</i>

<i>He is flanked on either side by dormitory doors. One man with an unsteady gait progresses down the hallway. Of course the vow of shared silence forbids him to offer assistance.</i>

<i>The hallway fades into a junction of nurses' station and what he can only imagine is the exit. Courtesy states he may look but never touch.</i>
