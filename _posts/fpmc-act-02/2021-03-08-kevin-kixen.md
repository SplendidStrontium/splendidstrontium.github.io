### // MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME // 

<i>When the boards go silent, KEVIN MARSCAPONE stays and lurks for a little while, waiting to see if any new messages propogate.</i>

<i>Nothing comes. No one has any information about the Tang girl.</i>

<i>He shuts down the computer and leaves his bedroom. In the spacious landing of the second floor of his home, a corner has been designated for his painting supplies. He set them up with care upon move-in, making sure each paintbrush was exactly where he wanted it. Nothing should stand in his way when the idea struck.</i>

<i>But the inspiration has been slow these days.</i>

<i>During his youth, the color had flown freely from his hand. He had created so long as his energy lasted. But he is troubled and his mind is quiet.</i>

<i>He looks toward the other side of the home where a spare bedroom had been used for months by CEDRIC.</i>

<br><I>Without CEDRIC around, the spacious home is occupied only by him. Though he has no need to speak aloud to the Prince of Dream, the sound of his voice is comforting and lends some normalcy to the conversation.</i>

> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

> IT WAS NICE HAVING HIM. I THINK SKITTLES AND KIX LIKED IT TOO.

<br><I>At the thought, he raises his voice and calls to his feline companions.</i>

#### KEVIN

> HERE, KITTY! HERE, KITTY-KITTY!

<br><I>A moment passes and up the stairs come the soft pitter-patter of two cats. KIX uses the side of an easel to rub his flank. SKITTLES wonders whether the master is in the mood to retreive the treats from atop a nearby wardrobe.</i>

<i>KEVIN bends down to spend a few minutes appreciating the soft fluff both the cats are covered in. For two brothers, their fur seems remarkably different, but both are densely downy.</i>

<i>SKITTLES meows loudly.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> SORRY, KIDDO. IT'S NOT FEEDING TIME YET.

<br><I>He gives the cat a conciliatory scruffle of the chin and cheek.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I'M GLAD THEY'RE HERE. GLAD THEY'RE ALIVE.

<br>FROM: ANGELA PLEASANT (personal)

TO: KEVIN MARSCAPONE (personal)

My Dearest Kevin,

My apologies for not doing this in person but a personal matter has arisen that I must attend to. But I didn't want to leave you in the dark for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I've already taken enough of your time.

I don't think we can see each other outside of work anymore. It's not that I don't enjoy your company; I rather do. But besides the fact that it's unprofessional and I never quite felt right about the whole thing... I'm seeing someone else.

I'm sorry. I hope we can still share our work at coffee hour, whenever that will be. You are brilliant and I look forward to seeing what you've accomplished during your sabbatical.

All the best,

ANGELA
<br>

<br><i>KEVIN walks downstairs, past the ground floor, and enters the basement. A number of unpacked boxes have been pushed up against the wall. A large tank filled with a dark, viscous liquid glows with an eerie greenish light.</i>

<i>He takes a seat on a yoga mat laid out on the stone floor, faces the empty tank, and begins to meditate.</i>
