*****
<br><i>CEDRIC walks into the BLUE VELVET and takes a seat at the bar, leaving a buffer seat between him and the nearest person on his left.</i>

<i>Like every night, he wears his patterned Mandarin jacket and trousers.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> GIN AND TONIC, DIET TONIC. GARNISHED WITH LEMON.

<br><i>As he predicted, the man seated to his left has his ears open. He speaks without looking over.</i>

#### VICTIM

> THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC DRINK ORDER.

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT?

#### VICTIM

> WHOA, WHOA.
> 
> I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHING BY IT. I'VE ALWAYS DETESTED ICE-BREAKERS.

<BR><I>The young man is brunet and tall, even awkward in the barstool. He scoots over to occupy the empty seat next to CEDRIC.</i>

<i>The victim has hazel eyes that shine wet in the dim light. He wears a dress shirt in cotton unbuttoned to tease a white undershirt within. He's sitting on his overcoat.</i>

<i>CEDRIC says nothing. The man takes a drink from his glass.</i>

#### VICTIM

> DO YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

<BR><I>CEDRIC smiles inwardly.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> IT'S NOT MY FIRST RODEO.

#### VICTIM

> ME EITHER.

#### CEDRIC

> DO YOU MAKE A HABIT OF PREYING ON EVERY GAY THAT COMES THROUGH THE DOOR?

#### VICTIM

> ONLY THE ONES THAT DRESS AS SHARPLY AS YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> HOW OLD ARE YOU?

#### VICTIM

> THIRTY-TWO. ON A BAD DAY, THIRTY-THREE. THIRTY-FOUR IF I NEED A SHAVE.
> 
> YOU...?
> 
> YOU AREN'T A DAY OVER 28.

#### CEDRIC

> GENEROUS.

#### VICTIM

> SO. 
> 
> HOW WAS YOUR TURKEY DAY?

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T EAT TURKEY.

#### VICTIM

> VEGETARIAN?

#### CEDRIC

> NO. 
> 
> I JUST DON'T EAT TURKEY.

#### VICTIM

> OH MAN, YOU EVER HAD ONE OF THOSE TOFURKIES?

#### CEDRIC

> HAVEN'T, NO.

#### VICTIM

> I WENT TO ONE OF MY FRIEND'S VEGETARIAN FEAST A FEW YEARS AGO.
> 
> HE PREPARED ONE.
> 
> IT WAS SAD. 
> 
> COMES WITH STUFFING INSIDE. 
> 
> WAS OKAY SMOTHERED WITH GRAVY.

#### CEDRIC

> KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE, DOESN'T IT?

#### VICTIM

> HEY, IT WAS MUSHROOM GRAVY.
> 
> ... 
> 
> SO. WHY DON'T YOU EAT TURKEY?

#### CEDRIC

> DON'T CARE FOR IT.
> 
> I FIND THE WHOLE THING A BIT PERVERSE, REALLY; THE PREY DRESSED UP IN A PILGRIM'S HAT ASKING 'WHAT'S FOR DINNER?'
> 
> KIND OF CONFUSES THE WHOLE MESSAGE OF GRATITUDE.

#### VICTIM

> I CAN SEE THAT.

#### CEDRIC

> THEY DIDN'T EVEN WEAR THOSE HATS, YOU KNOW.

#### VICTIM

> PILGRIMS?

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH. IT'S A MODERN INVENTION. 
> 
> THE PILGRIMS NEVER WORE HATS WITH BUCKLES ON THEM.

#### VICTIM

> I GUESS IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE.

#### CEDRIC

> NO, NOT MUCH.

<BR><I>The barkeep serves CEDRIC his clear drink. CEDRIC squeezes the lemon into the drink. When his fingers are dampened with juice, he rubs them together and uses the sensation to recenter his focus. The scent is sharp and clean.</i>

<i>He takes a sip.</i>

#### VICTIM

> HOW IS IT?

<BR><I>The man acted with a peculiar ownership of the place, rather off-putting.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

#### VICTIM

> YOU DON'T NEED DIET.

#### CEDRIC

> I PREFER THE TASTE OF IT.

#### VICTIM

> YOU DON'T LIKE --

#### CEDRIC

> I SAID I PREFER THE TASTE OF IT.

#### VICTIM

> CURIOUS CURIOUS.

<BR><I>CEDRIC feigns interest in the sports
