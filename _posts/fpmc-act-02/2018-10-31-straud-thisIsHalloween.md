<br><i>I met Eliza Pancakes at the Blue Velvet on Halloween. We were doing our yearly spooky movie marathon and they were playing Coppola's 1992 Dracula.</i>

<i>She was entranced.</i>

### // BLUE VELVET //

<br><i>I walk up to her.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FILM?

#### ELIZA

> I LOVE IT. 
> 
> I'M A BIG FAN OF COPPOLA'S STUFF.

#### STRAUD

> I FIND THE DEPICTION OF THE MASTER COUNT TO BE QUITE...
> 
> OH, HOW DO YOU SAY, AH...
> 
> BAROQUE.

<BR><I>She agrees as I cite matters of his style of dress.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THE CASTLE HAS FAR TOO MUCH FURNITURE.
> 
> WHO MAINTAINS ALL OF THAT FINERY?

<BR><I>I take this moment to be a bit more direct.</i>

#### STRAUD

> AND IF THE WOMEN WERE WHORES, DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY WERE SUCH INSUFFERABLE GOSSIPS?

#### ELIZA 

> I...SUPPOSE NOT.

#### STRAUD

> THE WHOLE OUTFIT OF THE VAN HELSING VAMPIRE HUNTING SQUAD FEELS A LITTLE SCOOBY DOO.
> 
> COMPLETE WITH ITS MULTI-LAYERED STORYLINES INTERLOCKING THE MAIN CHARACTERS TOGETHER.
> 
> HE LOVES HER BUT SHE LOVES HIM...
> 
> NO, INDEED, THE LIFESTYLES WERE A BIT MORE CHASTE AND PLACID.

#### ELIZA

> I SUPPOSE, SO HIGH WAS THE CHANCE OF ACQUIRING AN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY.

#### STRAUD

> PRECISELY, MY DEAR CHILD.
> 
> SUCH THINGS HAPPENED FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT TO MAKE A VOCATION OF IT --
> 
> DEAR ME, NO.
> 
> BUT I SUPPOSE ALL STORIES GET RETOLD ERA AFTER ERA.

#### ELIZA

> YOU SEEN THE WHOLE THING?

#### STRAUD

> NO.
> 
> I HAVE NOT.

#### ELIZA 

> YOU SHOULD WATCH IT SOMETIME, I THINK IT GETS BETTER.

#### STRAUD

> PERHAPS I'LL PUT IT ON MY LIST THEN.

<BR><I>The conversation hangs for a minute, as if to finish, but I just can't put it down.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I ALWAYS TAKE OFFENSE WHEN THEY CHANGE SO MUCH OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL.
> 
> WHY CHANGE THE CHARACTERS AROUND?
> 
> DO THEY THINK MODERN AUDIENCES ARE TOO SLACK TO UNDERSTAND THE FAIRLY SIMPLE RELATIONSHIP AS PRESENTED.
> 
> LUCY AND MINA WERE FRIENDS, MINA WAS ENGAGED TO WED JONATHAN HARKER, AND HARKER WAS THE PRIMARY VICTIM OF THE DARK LORD.

#### ELIZA

> HAHA.
> 
> DORK LORD.

#### STRAUD

> DORK LORD, MA'AM?
> 
> DARK LORD.

#### ELIZA

> YEAH BUT YOU SAID DORK LORD.

#### STRAUD

> I DO NOT THINK I DID, MAD'AM, BUT PERHAPS I DID.
> 
> EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

<BR><I>And that was how I met Eliza Pancakes.</i>

<i>The first time I went to their house, the first thing I noticed were their separate spaces. It was not just the separate beds alone -- the practice of bedsharing considered novel by some -- but that their activity spaces were so separate from the other. </i>

<i>Such is a common practice especially in childless households but this was striking -- and extended down to the color palette.</i>

<i>Eliza was funny enough and eager to entertain a fairytale prince but Bob was less impressed. He was steadfast to his ideal that I could work no magic. She was manic in her mannerisms & Bob unflinching. Everyone has a gift & hers was the gift of gab. I respected her for it.</i>

<i>The space in their small home was well-used, however, and I liked it.</i>
