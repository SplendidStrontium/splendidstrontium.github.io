## // MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME // ##

<i>KEVIN MARSCAPONE, the son of famed sorceress MYRTLE MARSCAPONE, has decided to help his mother train the young woman LUCIA EKSTROM in the ways of magic.</i>

<i>CASSANDRA GOTH has brought her over, dropped her off, but does not come in the house. Her return trip has not been booked; presumably she'll hear soon.</i>

<i>LUCIA walks up to the sprawling beach house and knocks shyly on the door.</i>

<i>She doesn't receive an answer for a moment, then takes her phone out of her pocket with the intention of calling someone, anyone, who might be inside the house.</i>

<i>She has just unlocked the cover screen when the door opens.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WELCOME WELCOME. PLEASE COME IN.

<I>KEVIN is tall and thin with a splash of auburn hair. He has an honest face, one that people expect to hide few lies. He is wearing a white t-shirt and khaki pants.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WE JUST MOVED IN ABOUT A WEEK AGO SO PLEASE EXCUSE THE MESS.

<I>But there's little mess to be had in the wide room. Stairs up and down, located right ahead of the entrance, divide the room in two, with a living area to the right and a dining room to the left. The house has a very faint musty scent, perhaps from the antique furniture that doesn't all match.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> OH PLEASE. IT'S LOVELY.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">'Lovely', huh?</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN is somewhat of a dual personality, though you wouldn't know it by his polite behavior. His father, VINCENT, a powerful vampire and the Prince of Dream, has taken up residence inside his son's psyche after his death some odd decade prior.</i>

<i>Except on the 'Net, VINCENT speaks in a voice that only KEVIN can hear.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> SO HOW'D THE SESSION WITH MY MOTHER GO?

### LUCIA ###

> WELL ENOUGH. 

> I HAD HEARD TALE OF HER BEING ...

> ROUGH ON HER STUDENTS.

> BUT SHE'S ...

> WELL, YEAH. ROUGH.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mean.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Evil, some would say.</p>
</div>

### LUCIA ###

> SHE WANTED TO WORK ON...

> HOME ECONOMICS.

### KEVIN ###

> I SEE.

<I>Down the stairs comes CEDRIC, who turns toward the dining room and does not acknowledge KEVIN's student.</i>

<i>But she cannot hide her curiosity and her eyes wander, eyeing the blonde man over KEVIN's shoulder.</i>

<i>CEDRIC disappears into the kitchen, out of eyeshot of LUCIA.</I>

<I>KEVIN allows a moment of silence, watching LUCIA.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WELL, I HAVE NO SUCH MAID'S WORK PLANNED FOR YOU TODAY.

> ALTHOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH,

> I HAVEN'T PLANNED MUCH OF ANYTHING AND JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE WE GET.

> ARE YOU HUNGRY?

### LUCIA ###

> NO, NOT TERRIBLY SO. 

> CASSANDRA AND I STOPPED ON THE WAY IN.

> SHE'S NICE.

### KEVIN ###

> I'M SORRY THAT BELLA WASN'T ABLE TO TUTOR YOU.

### LUCIA ###

> WELL, IT WASN'T ME WHO REALLY KNEW HER.

> SHE WAS A FRIEND OF MY MOTHER'S.

> BUT SHE ALWAYS IMPRESSED UPON ME THAT I SHOULD DROP IN IF I EVER FOUND MYSELF IN THE STATES.

### KEVIN ###

> PITY THAT THE OLD FAMILY TIES ARE...

> FRACTURING.

> HAVE YOU BEEN TO AMERRKA BEFORE?

<I>LUCIA shakes her head.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> NO, NEVER.

### KEVIN ### 

> I SUPPOSE YOU MAY BE FINDING YOUR MAGICKS ARE HARDER TO ACCESS.

<I>KEVIN crosses his arms, readjusting his posture.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> THE LEY-LINES SIT DIFFERENTLY HERE, AND ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST COAST, FEWER AND FAR BETWEEN.

> THE ONES THAT ARE HERE, HOWEVER, VARY IN INTENSITY. SO SOMETIMES YOU GET A SPARK THAT YOU'D NEVER EXPECT.

> YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE LUNAR LIGHT?

### LUCIA ###

> IN MY COUNTRY, QUITE EASILY. BUT HERE...

> I CAN, BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

> I... UH...

> HAVE SET SOME SMALL FIRES.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Excellent.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. 

> I DO NOT THINK WE WILL HAVE ANY PROBLEM, THEN.

> PLEASE, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME AND WE WILL LIGHT A BONFIRE THIS EVENING.

> MY MOTHER PREFERS TO USE LATINATE ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE, SO PLEASE MEDITATE ON THE WORD.

> (carefully) 'INFERNIATE'.

<i>KEVIN leaves the room abruptly, leaving LUCIA sinking into the oversoft fabric couch.</i>

<center>~</center>

<i>After browsing the books and being struck by twinges of boredom, LUCIA pushes around various fittings in the TV cabinet. She jumps when she hears a voice from behind her that she didn't know had been watching her.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> YOU LOOKIN' FOR THE HEX-BOX?

### LUCIA ###

> OH JEEZ. YOU SCARED ME.

### CEDRIC ### 

> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

### LUCIA ###

> YEAH... WELL... I SAW THE CONTROLLERS...

### CEDRIC ###

> I HAD ONE IN MY OLD PLACE.

> JUST PUT THE CONTROLLERS THERE. SEEMED THEY BELONGED.

> BUT I HAD AN OLD MODEL.

> I SOLD IT.

> TO BUY CAT FOOD.

<I>His tone is deliberate and strange. He wears a young man's clothing and appears in his mid twenties, but carries an air of distance that betrays his appearance.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> OH... UH... 

> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD CATS.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, THEY'RE BEING SHY.

> THEY'LL COME AROUND.

<I>LUCIA gets a solid look at him after seeing him from afar at a few of her lessons. CEDRIC has a faded scar down the middle of his face.</i>

<i>But it's not the scar that draws her attention.</i>

### LUCIA ###

> YOUR HAIR... YOU HAVE NICE HAIR.

<I>CEDRIC fluffs his short blond hair somewhat awkwardly.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> UH... THANKS?

### LUCIA ### 

> YOU KNOW IF I MET YOU IN MY COUNTRY, WITH HAIR LIKE THAT --

> I'D SAY YOU WERE DESCENDED FROM THE OLD GODS.

> ARE YOU BORN HERE?

### CEDRIC ###

> BORN AND BRED. AT LEAST THREE GENERATIONS. MORE, PROBABLY.

<I>The conversation hangs. Neither party is sure of the other.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> SO. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PRACTICING?

### LUCIA ###

> SINCE AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

> I HAD A KNACK FOR BREAKING THINGS WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL THEN I'M REALLY GLAD I SOLD MY TOY.

<CENTER>~</CENTER>

<I>The evening winds on and the sun begins to set. At twilight, early at this time of the year, KEVIN invites them outside to enjoy a bonfire. CEDRIC stands off to the side, somewhat skittish to flying embers. He steps around from time to time but generally remains out of earshot.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> CREATING WILDFIRE SHOULD BE EASIER THAN LUNAR CONJURATIONS.

> YOU ARE DOING MORE WORK THAN YOU SHOULD.

> YOU FEEL THE DISTANCE FROM THE LEYLINES AND THAT CAUSES YOU ANXIETY. FEAR.

> IT'S NATURAL TO FEEL THAT WAY BUT I THINK IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF, YOU CAN EASILY LEARN TO CONTROL THE FLAME.

> WATCH IT DANCE.

### LUCIA ###

> YOU ARE FROM HERE, TOO?

### KEVIN ###

> I'VE BEEN A NEW YORKER ALL MY LIFE.

### LUCIA ### 

> THEN IT'S EASIER FOR YOU.

### KEVIN ###

> DON'T LET YOURSELF BE CLOUDED WITH PERCEPTIONS OF RELATIVE DIFFICULTY.

> THE STRUGGLES OF OTHERS IS AN ETERNAL UNKNOWN.

> A TRUE UNKNOWN.

> FOCUS ON WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

<I>The fire crackles and burns. </i>

### KEVIN ###

> FOCUS ON TODAY, ON NOW, BUT ALSO HEAT, AND WARMTH.

> LOVE AND HATRED, TWO SIDES OF THE SAME PASSION.

> I ALWAYS FEEL WATCHING NATURE, THE MOTHER, WORK HER MAGIC EFFORTLESSLY --

<I>He gestures to the fire.</i>

> HELPS REMIND US THAT ALL THINGS TURN TO ASH IN TIME.

<i>They are silent until CEDRIC disappears inside the house. LUCIA sees her opportunity and grabs it.</i>

### LUCIA ### 

> WERE YOU REALLY A VAMPIRE? BEFORE?

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Whoo-ee this girl wastes no time.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> I SUPPOSE YOU READ ABOUT THAT ON THE 'NET.

### LUCIA ###

> YEAH, I DID. I HACKED ON TO THE 'NET A FEW YEARS BACK.

> I READ ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MOTHER THERE.

### KEVIN ###

> I DOUBT MOST OF IT WAS TRUE.

> THE OLD POSTS ARE FULL OF HALF-TRUTHS AND EXAGGERATIONS.

> SECURITY'S A LOT TIGHTER THESE DAYS.

### LUCIA ###

> BUT... YOU DID TAKE THE CURE WILLINGLY?

### KEVIN ###

> I DID. WITH THE HELP OF MY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS.

> THE PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE MEANT THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS.

> AND I LONGED TO AGAIN...

<I>KEVIN draws his hands together and pulls them apart to reveal a burning ember, oranger and yet bluer than the one from the campfire.</i>

> FEEL WARM.
