<br/><i>It's been two days since the runaway AVAELLE EASTON has been returned to her home in Brooklyn. KEVIN MARSCAPONE had [brought the young woman]({% post_url /fpmc-act-02/2021-10-13-straud-x %}) to meet AVAEL and receive a quasi-blessing for VLADISLAUS STRAUD to probe her memories. AVAEL stated that she felt she could not forbid such an operation, unwilling to accept the title of "Mother".</i>

<i>AVAEL expressed a desire to 'forget' her troublesome past and asked STRAUD for his help in the future.</i>
