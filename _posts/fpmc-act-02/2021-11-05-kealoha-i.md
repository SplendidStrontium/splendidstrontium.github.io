<p class="ppl-sez">KEALOHA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I am here to thank you for your gift but there are a number of issues I need to discuss with you.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's been a whirlwind over the three years since we met.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">First of all, thank you for the suncreme; without it I would not be able to be a part of my little girl's life. She means the world to me and I'm trying to prove to her that I am a worthy father.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But it doesn't change that you haven't told me everything.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">These books you've given me, I've read them cover to cover but I've found nothing that teaches us how to perpetuate ourselves. Meaning we're meant to be beholden to you. Meaning you intend yourself to be the gatekeeper. Meaning you've less given us a Gift and more given us a dependence.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">What if I outlast my family, what then?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">During my stay in NYC, my wife brought in a young man, a sort of au pair, to help with Nani. I hate him, detest him, can't believe she brought in someone else. But what can I say? It was my fault, my decision to leave.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I will have to thank Cedric, as he convinced me to return home. He couldn't have known what was going on in my home, but it was still the right decision for me to come back before he became too entrenched in my family.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't know what I'll do about him. I should be happy that my daughter has someone else to help her with homework, to pick her up from school -- But I'm not. I'm furious. I'm insulted.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To make matters worse, you seem to have all but abandoned me.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I want to learn how to give the Gift.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">If you won't teach me, I'll find someone who will.</p>
