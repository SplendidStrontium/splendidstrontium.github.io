### // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<BR><I>Cedric has left Kevin behind and fled into the basement sanctum in an effort at solitude. But he has been followed by the house's Elder.</i>

#### VINCENT

> GET CLEANED UP. 
> 
> WE'RE GOING OUT.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WEAR?
> 
> ALL MY CLOTHES --

#### VINCENT

> IT DOESN'T MATTER.
> 
> LOOK THROUGH THE DRAWERS, TAKE ANYTHING YOU FIND SUITABLE.

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T THINK KEVIN'S CLOTHES WILL FIT ME.

#### VINCENT

> DID I SAY THAT THEY WOULD?

#### CEDRIC

> IS THIS HOW YOU USUALLY DO THINGS?

<BR><I>Vincent straightens his back.</i>

#### VINCENT

> IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNGLINGS TO FEED EARLY AND OFTEN, LEST THE BEAST TAKE HOLD.
> 
> WHEN YOU ARE MORE EXPERIENCED, YOU CAN FIND PREY ON YOUR OWN TIME.
> 
> BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU AND KEVIN AND SEE THAT THINGS ARE SET UP FOR YOUR SUCCESS.
> 
> WE'RE GOING TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.

#### CEDRIC

> THE BOWLING ALLEY?

#### VINCENT

> DID I STUTTER?

#### CEDRIC

> I'M TERRIBLE AT BOWLING. 
> 
> I HATE IT.

#### VINCENT

> IT DOES NOT MATTER.
> 
> THE MORTALS WILL HAVE NO CONCERN FOR YOUR SCORECARD.

#### CEDRIC

> CAN'T WE JUST GO TO A BAR OR SOMETHING?

#### VINCENT

> NOT TONIGHT.

<BR><I>Cedric opens the drawer to find a plethora of tightly rolled shirts in plain, drab colors.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO IN WHAT I HAVE ON.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>The trio collect at the basement door and step out into a cool night. They walk along in silence for quite some time, each dealing with their anxieties in their own way.</i>

<i>Every break in their formation suggests an escape route. The crisp air an invitation to flee. He'd leave this madhouse and look for a cure for this curse on his own.</i>

#### VINCENT

> BARS ARE NOT THE EASIEST PLACES TO HUNT. 
> 
> A YOUNGLING CAN EASILY FALL TO SECOND-HAND SMOKE -- THE FEELING OF DRUNKENNESS CAUGHT FROM THE UNSUSPECTING AMONG YOU.
> 
> THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS MINGLE WITH YOURS. 
> 
> IT CLOUDS YOUR FOCUS.
> 
> NOT TO MENTION IT'S A PRIME PLACE TO CATCH OLD MEMORIES GATHERING ON THE WIND.

#### KEVIN

> PLUS I CAN'T GET IN.

#### VINCENT

> PLUS HE CAN'T GET IN.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU DON'T HAVE A FAKE ID?
> 
> I CAN --

<BR><I>No. He couldn't get him anything. He had nothing.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I CERTAINLY LOOK THE PART.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'RE NEARLY READY.
> 
> WE HAVE AVENUES.

<BR><I>In the streetlight, the two of them seemed to glow and their skin seemed more alabaster than rose. </i>

<i>Would this befall him, too?</i>
<br><br>

*****
#### BETHANY

> BETHANY.

#### AMANDA

> AMANDA.

#### TRISHA

> TRISHA.

#### TIFFANY

> TIFFANY.

<BR><I>Four young women took the alley next to theirs. Cedric felt little but revulsion choked by the stench of shoes. </i>

#### TRISHA

> IS THAT YOUR DAD?

#### KEVIN

> YEAH.

#### TRISHA

> YOU'RE THE SPITTING IMAGE!

#### KEVIN

> THANK YOU.

#### AMANDA

> TRISH!
> 
> IT'S YOUR TURN!

<BR><I>Finally a moment of silence. Cedric turns to Kevin as they take seats next to one another.</i>

<I>He lowers his voice to take advantage of the privacy afforded by the din of the alley.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WOMEN?

#### KEVIN

> WHY DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T KNOW. 
> 
> SOME CLAIM OF CHIVALRY.

#### KEVIN

> I'M NOT SEXIST.

#### CEDRIC

> NEITHER AM I...
> 
> JUST...

#### VINCENT

> CEDRIC! 
> 
> YOU'RE UP.

<BR><I>Cedric picks up the bowling ball and rolls it down the lane.</i>

<i>The girls clap for him and allow him to rejoin his conversation with Kevin.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME HOW.

#### KEVIN

> IT'S LIKE INSTINCT.
> 
> IT'LL COME TO YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

#### KEVIN

> FOLLOW YOUR FANGS.

<BR><I>Cedric runs his tongue along his teeth. They felt...still...ordinary.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MINE WERE LIKE A KITTEN'S.
> 
> UNFORGIVINGLY SHARP.

<BR><I>He turns from Cedric and leaves to talk to the women. </i>

<i>In his absence, Cedric looks at Vincent. He returns the gaze before coming to sit in the abandoned seat.</i>

#### VINCENT

> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FAIRLY GOOD FOR HATING THE GAME.

#### CEDRIC

> IT REMINDS ME OF THINGS I'D RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT.

#### VINCENT

> YOU HAD BETTER GET USED TO IT.
> 
> GROWING UP MEANS YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO THINK.
> 
> THANKFULLY YOU ENJOY BOOKS, DON'T YOU?

#### CEDRIC

> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

#### VINCENT

> YOU WERE A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

#### CEDRIC

> THE HEADMISTRESS?

#### VINCENT

> SHE IS A BIT OF A GOSSIP.

#### CEDRIC

> I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'LL BE FINE.
> 
> JUST TALK ABOUT THAT NEW TOM CRUISE FLICK.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

#### VINCENT

> YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT THAT I DON'T JOKE ABOUT MUCH.
> 
> HOW DID YOU DO IT WHEN YOU WERE A BOY OF TALENT?

#### CEDRIC

> I DIDN'T.

#### VINCENT

> YOU CERTAINLY DID KEEP SECRETS.
> 
> EVEN NOW YOU PUSH ME OUT YET YOU LONG TO BE FREE.

#### CEDRIC

> I'LL NEVER BE FREE.

#### VINCENT

> IT'S AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT THAT WILL KEEP YOU AN ETERNAL PRISONER.

#### CEDRIC

> THIS IS NOT FREEDOM.

#### VINCENT

> NO, IT'S NOT.
> 
> BUT THEY DON'T ENJOY IT EITHER.
> 
> DID YOU ENJOY FREEDOM AS A YOUNG MAN?

#### CEDRIC

> I THOUGHT I'D GET THERE SOMEDAY.

#### VINCENT

> AND THAT KEPT YOU GOING THEN.

#### KEVIN

> DAD, YOU'RE UP.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>It seemed the quartet of women would stop at nothing to earn their favor. Cedric felt an encroaching dread fill him as the turns dragged on. The flashing lights flooded his vision. The crashing pins were a din he could hardly stand.</i>

<i>Time pulled him forward as an unwilling observer. He yearned to stop it all. He longed to flee back to that forested road. And maybe this time, it all would end.</i>

<i>Bethany reminded him of someone, a face he had left far behind. In this moment, her name was lost to him.</i>

#### BETHANY

> IS THAT YOUR DAD?

<BR><I>He scoffed.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT, DO WE LOOK ALIKE?

#### BETHANY

> NO, NOT REALLY.

#### CEDRIC

> MY MOTHER REMARRIED.

#### BETHANY

> OH, I SEE.

<BR><I>She lifted her hand to twirl a lock of her hair loose about her crown. Cedric's steely tone had frozen her into silence.</i>

#### BETHANY

> YOU SEEN ANY GOOD MOVIES LATELY?

#### CEDRIC 

> I'M MORE OF A BOOK GUY.

#### VINCENT

> OH THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY TRUE.
> 
> YOUR MOTHER HAD US WATCH THAT ATROCIOUS FILM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

<BR><I>As if a plea, Cedric searches for the eyes of the boy Kevin. But he's no where to be found. Nor are two of the women.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHERE'S KEVIN?

#### VINCENT

> HIS SHOES WERE BOTHERING HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO TRADE THEM IN FOR ANOTHER PAIR.

<BR><I>Cedric looks over his shoulder toward the desk. But Kevin is nowhere to be seen.</i>

#### VINCENT

> IS IT TRUE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE VAMPIRE THAT ATTRACTS WOMEN?

#### BETHANY

> I LIKE BUFFY.

#### VINCENT

> THE FABLED KILLER OF THE VAMPIRE.

<BR><I>Cedric hated to be talked over. This man, little more than a legend originating from the Headmistress' personal effects, strode about as if his sole joy came from laughter he never shared with anyone but himself.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THE MOVIE. 
> 
> BESIDE THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE THING SEEMED RUSHED.

<BR><I>Bethany had rich brown eyes like polished mahogany. Her lips were plump, parted slightly, revealing white teeth set slightly askew. She was the picture of vigor.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HER VAMPIRES SHOULD BLEED BLOOD.

<BR><I>But the meaning wasn't clear.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> ER. NOT BLEED. 
> 
> CRY. 
> 
> THEY SHOULD CRY BLOOD.

<BR><i>Vincent smirked.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH, THAT'S A DETAIL SHE INCLUDES IN THE BOOKS.
> 
> BUT THEY DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE ADAPTATION.

#### BETHANY

> WHAT'S A VAMPIRE GOT TO CRY ABOUT, ANYHOW?

#### VINCENT

> WE CAN'T ALL BE SUPERHUMAN LIKE LESTAT.
> 
> OF COURSE THE ENDING IS REALLY TERRIBLE.

#### CEDRIC

> THAT'S MORE OR LESS HOW RICE DID IT.

#### VINCENT

> OF COURSE.
> 
> IT WAS A FAIRLY FAITHFUL ADAPTATION --
> 
> BUT THAT SONG.

#### BETHANY

> WHAT SONG?

#### VINCENT

> "WON'T YOU GUESS MY NAME"?!

<BR><I>She titters flirtatiously.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> LESTAT BECOMES A ROCK STAR IN THE CHRONICLES.
> 
> IT'S ALL A BIT SILLY, REALLY.

#### BETHANY

> DO THAT AGAIN.

#### VINCENT

> "PLEASED TO MEET YA, WON'T YOU GUESS MY NAME?"

<BR><I>Cedric draws his jaw upward into a grimace.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I'M GOING TO GO FIND KEVIN.

<BR>

*****
#### CEDRIC

> YOUR FATHER IS INTOLERABLE.

#### KEVIN

> HE'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH AT TIMES.

#### CEDRIC

> HE'S FLIRTING WITH A GIRL HALF HIS AGE.
> 
> WELL. HALF AS OLD AS HE LOOKS.
> 
> IS IT HIS USUAL TO PLAY WITH HIS FOOD?

#### KEVIN

> HE'S PUTTING ON A SHOW.
> 
> HE DOES THAT.

#### CEDRIC

> WHY?

#### KEVIN

> YOU.

<BR><i>The scent of shoes -- an amalgamation of horrid sweat -- wafts through the air. The pair stand wordlessly as the crowd meanders underneath the high ceiling.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T WANT THIS.

#### KEVIN

> THE CHOICE WAS TAKEN FROM YOU, JUST AS IT WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> MY BEST GUESS IS THAT MY PARENTS WISHED ME INTO EXISTENCE, UNAWARE THAT I WOULD BEAR MY FATHER'S CURSE.
> 
> OR AT LEAST, I HOPE THEY WERE UNAWARE.

#### CEDRIC

> THIS IS ALL PERVERSE.

#### KEVIN

> IT IS.

#### CEDRIC

> THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GODDAMNED...TELEVISION!

#### KEVIN

> THERE'S NO EASIER WAY TO GET A MAN TO TALK THAN TO ASK HIM TO SPEAK ABOUT HIMSELF.

#### CEDRIC

> DID HE DO THIS TO YOU TOO?
> 
> SHOVE YOU INTO A THRONG OF PEOPLE ARMED ONLY WITH A POCKET KNIFE?

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T FOLLOW.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

#### KEVIN

> TRY TO PUT YOUR HATRED ASIDE.
> 
> THE MORE YOU LOVE THEM, THE HARDER IT IS.
> 
> TRY TO FEEL NOTHING.

#### CEDRIC

> I CAN'T DO THAT.

#### KEVIN

> THE THIRST WON'T KILL YOU. 
> 
> IT NEVER DOES.
> 
> IT ONLY MAKES YOU SUFFER.
> 
> I'VE TRIED.

#### CEDRIC

> THEN I'LL SUFFER.

#### KEVIN

> YOU'LL GO INSANE.

#### CEDRIC

> NO WORSE THAN THIS.

#### KEVIN

> IT IS WORSE.
> 
> A LOT WORSE.

#### CEDRIC

> IF A SCROLL MADE ME INTO THIS THEN I'LL FIND THE ANTIDOTE.

#### KEVIN

> FOR THAT YOU'LL NEED YOUR LUCIDITY.
> 
> [pause]
> 
> WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU CAN CURE ME TOO.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>That night, with a brick wall at her back, a young woman looks into the eyes of oblivion.</i>

#### BETHANY

> ARE YOU GOING TO KISS ME, OR WHAT?

#### CEDRIC

> I'M SAYING MY GOODBYES.
> 
> I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

#### BETHANY

> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. 
> 
> I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER.

#### CEDRIC

> IT'S A BURNER.

#### BETHANY

> YOU PARTY?
> 
> WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

#### CEDRIC

> YOU WERE ALL OVER MY STEPDAD.

#### BETHANY

> WAS NOT!

#### CEDRIC

> DON'T LIE TO ME.

<BR><I>In the darkness, Cedric envelops the woman and sinks a pair of freshly sprung fangs into her neck. She gasps in surprise but is quickly silenced, her cries collapsing in her throat.</i>

<i>Bright crimson blood flows freely, warm and clean. Gravity draws a line across her collarbones but he laps it up.</i>

#### BETHANY

> WILL...I...DIE?

<BR><I>He stops and looks at her fluttering eyelids.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

<BR>
