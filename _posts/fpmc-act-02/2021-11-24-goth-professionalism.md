### // OLD GALANTOME ESTATE //

<br><i>The nights have been steadily lengthening in the suburbs of New York City. The trees are nearly bare as the fall season threatens to leave. In an aging Queens mansion lives CASSANDRA GOTH and her two guests. The foreign national LUCIA has not been seen in days, leaving the young woman alone with the mage LARRY POTTER.</i>

<i>LARRY came offering his ghost hunting services at the behest of the MARSCAPONE family shortly after the death of their Matron in the preceding spring. After the surprising success of his summoning rituals, CASSANDRA found herself a believer. She allowed the 'exterminator' to take up residence in one of the spare bedrooms in the hopes that he would rid an already spooky mansion of paranormal influence.</i>

<i>It is the day before Thanksgiving and CASSANDRA has no plans for the holiday. It is only the second holiday season since the death of her father. Last year she'd felt numb, still in shock over the loss of her parents. It hadn't yet seemed to touch her heart. But this year, it all feels too real: she is the eldest of the two Goth heirs.</i>

<i>But none of that seems to cloud her worries at the moment. She and LARRY are enjoying a late breakfast.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, IT ACTUALLY USED TO SNOW?

#### LARRY

> WHEN 'WE' WERE KIDS?

<BR><I>CASSANDRA doesn't respond to his goading; she gives a sly smirk, unyielding.</i>

#### LARRY

> IT'S STILL A LITTLE EARLY IN THE SEASON, DON'T YOU THINK?

#### CASSANDRA

> I DON'T KNOW. IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE COLDER EVEN BY THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
> 
> WE'VE SEEN NOTHING BUT RAIN. NOT EVEN FLURRIES.

#### LARRY

> THERE'S STILL TIME.
> 
> THE BIG SNOWSTORMS WILL FORM WHEN IT'S BEEN COLD FOR A LITTLE LONGER.
> 
> JANUARY, FEBRUARY, THAT KIND OF THING.
> 
> THE BIG '96 STORM WAS JANUARY.

<BR><I>CASSANDRA remains quiet again.</i>

#### LARRY

> ...NO?
> 
> WELL SHOOT. 

#### CASSANDRA

> YOU'RE RIGHT, THOUGH -- THE 2003 BLIZZARD WAS FEBRUARY, WASN'T IT?
> 
> AROUND VALENTINE'S DAY.

<BR><I>LARRY shudders as if he's outside in the cold.</i>

#### LARRY

> TWO-THOUSAND-THREE.
> 
> A BAD YEAR.

<BR><I>She changes the topic.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> I TALKED TO KEVIN YESTERDAY.
> 
> HE SAID... A VAMPIRE SNUCK INTO MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

#### LARRY

> A VAMPIRE?

#### CASSANDRA

> WELL, TECHNICALLY, HE SAID 'VAMPRESS', BUT...
> 
> THEY'RE THE SAME THING, AREN'T THEY?

#### LARRY

> THEY'RE THE SAME THING. 
> 
> THEY THINK THEY'RE BEING RESPECTFUL WHEN THEY TALK THAT WAY.

<BR><I>He tries to lighten his reproachful tone.</i>

#### LARRY

> I'M SORRY YOUR FATHER CHOSE <U>THEM</U> AS YOUR EXECUTORS.

#### CASSANDRA

> IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW YEARS.

#### LARRY

> A FEW YEARS TOO LONG.
> 
> IT'S YOUR MONEY.
