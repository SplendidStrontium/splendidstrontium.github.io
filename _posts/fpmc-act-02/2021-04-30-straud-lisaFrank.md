## // STRAUD MANSION // ##

<i>When SVETLANA arrives at my home, I'm just about to take the dog on a walk.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> HERE, MANDARC. YOU DO THE HONORS.

> I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS.

### MANDARC ###

> ME, SIR?

### STRAUD ###

> YES, YOU.

> WHO ELSE?

### MANDARC ###

> IT'S JUST THAT... IT'S STILL SO BRIGHT OUT.

> THE SUN REFLECTS SO VIOLENTLY OFF THE SNOW THIS TIME OF DAY.

### STRAUD ###

> MANDARC. 

> IT'S SPRING.

> THERE WILL BE NO SNOW ON THE GROUND.

### MANDARC ###

> [unsure] UH... RIGHT. OF COURSE.

> I FORGOT.

<I>MANDARC leaves with the dog. I hope he remembered his sun creme.</i>

<i>I go downstairs to answer the door. It is, indeed, SVETLANA, matron of the OBOROVSKY household. She's wearing her dress of mourning.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> VLADISLAUS. GOOD EVENING.

> HOW FARES IT?

### STRAUD ###

> DARKLY.

### SVETLANA ###

> THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR, MY FRIEND.

> MAY I COME IN?

### STRAUD ###

> YES, OF COURSE, MY LADY. MY HOME IS YOURS.

### SVETLANA ###

> I AM GRATEFUL.

> I NEED SHELTER.

<I>SVETLANA enters the home. She immediately walks toward the fireplace to warm herself. Her outstretched arms are slender, fair.</i>

> IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOME OF THE MASTER.

### STRAUD ###

> OH, SVETLANA. DON'T SAY THAT.

### SVETLANA ###

> I'LL SAY WHATEVER I WANT TO, OLD FRIEND.

<I>I try to change the topic of conversation.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> HOW ARE THE CHILDREN.

<I>She smiles, tenderly.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, THEY ARE WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

> SOMETIMES I WEEP AFTER I'VE PUT THEM ON THE SCHOOL BUS EACH DAY.

> MY MOTHER TOLD ME WEEPING IS BAD FOR THE COMPLEXION, SO I TRY NOT TO, BUT SOMETIMES THE TEARS OVERWHELM ME.

### STRAUD ###

> YES... I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY.

### SVETLANA ###

> IT'S SO BITTERSWEET -- I'M HAPPY THEY'RE LEARNING MORE AND GROWING STRONGER EACH DAY BUT IT COMES WITH THE UNFORTUNATE REALIZATION THAT MY DAYS, TOO, WILL SOON DRAW TO A CLOSE.

### STRAUD ###

> MADAM?

<I>I ask with generosity.</i>

> I'M SURE YOU HAVE MANY MORE A MOONRISE.

> PLEASE DON'T BE SO MELANCHOLY.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, STRAUD. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

> MY KIND ARE NOT LIKE YOURS.

> YOU GIVE TO YOUR OFFSPRING FREELY AND THEY ARE BATHED IN YOUR LIGHT.

> BUT WE ARE NOT LIKE YOU.

> WHEN I LAID MY EGGS, I GAVE PART OF MY SOUL-STUFF.

> AND LIKE A BEE WHO LOSES HER STINGER, I AM NOW DOOMED TO WASTE AWAY.

### STRAUD ###

> OH, I'M SURE IT'S NOT ALL... THAT BAD...

<I>But SVETLANA refutes my effort at consolation and begins to rage in her voice I cannot stand.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> DON'T TELL ME WHAT I DO AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY!

<I>But she shrinks, ashamed of having invoked the Voice.</i>

> OH, STRAUD. I'M SO SORRY. I SHOULDN'T GET IN SUCH A FIT, NOT AT MY AGE. MY HEART JUST CAN'T TAKE IT.

### STRAUD ###

> HEARTS ARE A FUNNY THING.

### SVETLANA ###

> THEY ARE, AREN'T THEY?

### STRAUD ###

> I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR BEING SO FORWARD, MADAM, BUT --

> WHY HAVE YOU COME?

> MY HOUSE IS ALWAYS OPEN TO YOU BUT I KNOW THE JOURNEY IS TRYING AND YOU WOULD NOT RISK THE TRIP LEST IT BE... ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

<I>I pause, calm. She looks into the fire.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> THE END OF MY DAYS APPROACHES AND I DO NOT WANT IT TO HAPPEN IN THE HOME WHERE MY CHILDREN COHABITATE.

> THEY ARE SUCH SWEET GIRLS, I AM AFRAID THE VERITY, OF... WHAT I AM...

> WILL RUIN THEM.

> I WANT TO SPARE THE GIRLS THAT FATE.

> THEY ARE LIKE THEIR FATHER.

### STRAUD ###

> OH, MISTRESS. I AM SURE THE YOUNG GIRLS WILL BE FINE.

### SVETLANA ###

> I'M SURE THEY WILL BE FINE, BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

### STRAUD ###

> MADAM. I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITHOUT YOUR CONSORT PRESENT.

### SVETLANA ###

> CEDRIC? OH, HE'S A CONSIDERATION, TOO.

> I WANT TO SPARE HIM MY FILTHY SECRET.

### STRAUD ###

> IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO BE TRUTHFUL, EVEN IF IT IS PAINFUL AT THE BEGINNING.

### SVETLANA ###

> BUT THAT'S JUST IT, I WANT TO SPARE HIM THE PAIN.

### STRAUD ###

> SOMETIMES ONE MUST ENDURE THE PAIN TO SEE A BETTER TOMORROW.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, STRAUD. YOU ARE EVER THE OPTIMIST.

### STRAUD ###

> YES, I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SUCH ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.

### SVETLANA ###

> NO, I'D PREFER YOU DIDN'T SUMMON THE YOUNG MAN.

> I DON'T WANT TO SOIL HIM WITH FOUL MEMORIES.

### STRAUD ###

> SPOIL? I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE HIM.

### SVETLANA ###

> YOU DON'T KNOW HIM LIKE I DO!

### STRAUD ###

> CERTAINLY NOT. I WASN'T TRYING TO IMPLY THAT I DID.

> I WOULD NEVER ATTEMPT TO USURP YOUR AUTHORITY, MY LADY.

### SVETLANA ###

> AS IS PROPER.

### STRAUD ###

> AS IS PROPER.

### SVETLANA ###

> CEDRIC IS YOUNG.

> HE WILL FIND ANOTHER LOVER.

> IT WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE TO GET INVOLVED WITH HIM.

### STRAUD ###

> THE HEART WANTS WHAT THE HEART WANTS.

### SVETLANA ###

> ISN'T IT TRUE.

> HAVE YOU EVER FALLEN IN LOVE, VLAD?

### STRAUD ###

> MA'AM?

### SVETLANA ###

> HAVE YOU EVER WISHED UPON A STAR?

### STRAUD ###

> ISN'T THAT THE STUFF OF FAIRY TALES?

### SVETLANA ###

> OH. I SUPPOSE SO.

### STRAUD ###

> I DO UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THE LOVE ONE MAY HAVE FOR ONE'S OWN OFFSPRING. WE WANT TO NURTURE THEM, SEE THEM PROSPER, SEE THEM BECOME MORE THAN WHAT WE OURSELVES ARE.

### SVETLANA ###

> YES, THAT IS WHAT I FEEL FOR ESTHER AND OPHELIA.

> THEY ARE SUCH DARLINGS.

### STRAUD ###

> YES, YOUR GIRLS ARE INDEED SOMETHING ELSE.

### SVETLANA ###

> THEY ARE, AREN'T THEY?

### STRAUD ###

> YOU AND ERIKSSON DID SUCH A METICULOUS JOB RAISING THEM.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, SEBASTIAN.

> I THINK OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME.

> HE WAS SUCH A DOTING FATHER. FAR BETTER THAN MYSELF.

### STRAUD ###

> YOU WERE A WONDERFUL MOTHER. YOUR GIRLS ADORE YOU.

### SVETLANA ###

> BUT IS THAT ADORATION DESERVED?

### STRAUD ###

> DARE I SAY, IF IT'S WORTH IT TO NAVEL-GAZE --

> THAT WE WILL NEVER FEEL ANY ADOLATION IS DESERVÃˆD.

### SVETLANA ###

> I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT.

> BUT ALLOW ME TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT TO SOMETHING A BIT MORBID.

> I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE MY FINAL CYCLE AND I'D LIKE YOU TO PERFORM THE RITUAL.

### STRAUD ###

> SVETLANA.

> I TRULY DOUBT THIS IS YOUR FINAL CYCLE.

> THE ELDER MARSCAPONE HAS RECENTLY MOVED ON SO YOU MAY HAVE MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, REALLY?

> MARSCAPONE IS FINALLY GONE FROM THIS PLANE?

### STRAUD ###

> YES. SHE'S DISAPPERATED.

### SVETLANA ###

> THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WAS SUCH A VALUABLE MENTOR FOR MY SONS.

### SVETLANA ###

> I KNOW CEDRIC HAD NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY OF THE OLD CRONE.

### STRAUD ###

> IT'S GOOD TO HEAR HE'S BEEN BEING POLITE.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, YES. ALWAYS.

### STRAUD ###

> UNFORTUNATELY THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS WORKING HIM TO THE BONE.

### SVETLANA ###

> WAS SHE?

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WAS.

### SVETLANA ###

> HE NEVER COMPLAINED.

### STRAUD ###

> HE WOULDN'T.

### SVETLANA ###

> I SUPPOSE NOT.

<I>I move over to the bar and prepare a refreshment for the woman.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> CAN I OFFER YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK?

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, VLAD. YOU ARE EVER THE GENTLEMAN BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T PREFER UNCARBONATED.

### STRAUD ###

> YES, MA'AM. I JUST WANTED TO OFFER YOU SOMETHING TO NUMB THE PAIN.

### SVETLANA ###

> THE PAIN OF KNOWING I WILL BEAR NO SONS OF SEBASTIAN?

> NOTHING DULLS THAT ENNUI.

### STRAUD ###

> I... EMPATHIZE.

### SVETLANA ###

> HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A GOOD FATHER, TOO.

> YOU WERE HIS SIRE, WERE YOU NOT?

### STRAUD ###

> I WAS.

### SVETLANA ###

> I WONDER WHAT HE WAS LIKE, BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED.

### STRAUD ###

> IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG AN EON FOR ME TO RECOUNT.

### SVETLANA ###

> OH, BUT YOU WILL, WON'T YOU; FOR AN OLD WOMAN ON HER DEATH BED?

### STRAUD ###

> HE FELL UNDER THE SIGN OF THE BEAR.

### SVETLANA ###

> THE BEAR? REALLY. I NEVER KNEW.

> I MYSELF WAS A FELID.

### STRAUD ###

> YES, MADAM. I AM WELL-AWARE.

### SVETLANA ###

> BEAR. YES. I SUPPOSE THAT EXPLAINS A FEW THINGS.

### STRAUD ###

> I'M SORRY I DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW SOONER, IT JUST...

### SVETLANA ###

> NEVER CAME UP. YES. I AM AWARE.

<I>SVETLANA takes a healthy drink of the offering I've prepared.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> YOU AND I, WE'RE ALIKE, ARE WE NOT, VLAD?

### STRAUD ###

> YES, MY LADY. WE ARE ALIKE.

*****

<I>The conversation has slowed; SVETLANA moving about the house, VLADISLAUS STRAUD hanging about the sitting room.</i>

<i>MANDARC has yet to return.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> [thinking] Finally. Taking the pup on the walk he deserves.

<i>SVETLANA approaches STRAUD.</I>

### SVETLANA ###

> WILL YOU MAKE MY BED AND LIE IN IT?

### STRAUD ###

> NO, MY LADY. I AM UNABLE.

> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SUMMON YOUR CONSORT?

### SVETLANA ###

> CEDRIC? NO. I WOULD NOT SUBJECT HIM TO SUCH SLAVERY.

### STRAUD ###

> SEBASTIAN, THEN.

### SVETLANA ###

> NO. HE HAS ALREADY DONE TOO MUCH FOR ME.

### STRAUD ###

> PERHAPS ONE OF YOUR GIRLS. ESTHER, OPHEL --

<I>SVETLANA raises her voice.</i>

### SVETLANA ###

> NO, VLAD! I WANT <U>YOU</U> TO DO IT!

### STRAUD ###

> MADAM. IT IS NOT PROPER...

### SVETLANA ###

> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT WHAT'S PROPER! I REFUSE TO INVOLVE THE YOUNG MEN IN MY FEMININE PROBLEMS.

### STRAUD ###

> IF THAT IS TRULY YOUR FINAL WISH, THEN I AM LOATHE TO REFUSE A LADY'S REQUEST.

### SVETLANA ###

> THAT IS THE LADY'S REQUEST.

### STRAUD ###

> THEN. THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

> WHAT WILL YOU TAKE AS YOUR FINAL WILL AND TESTAMENT?

### SVETLANA ###

> WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BUT A CHILD, MY FATHER TOOK HER TO THE PLAYGROUND. IT WAS A BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT DAY OF WEATHER. I KNOW BECAUSE MY FATHER TOOK AN EXCEPTIONAL PHOTOGRAPH OF HER -- HE LATER DRAFTED IT IN PENCIL AND GAVE IT TO ME AS A GIFT. 

> I NO LONGER HAVE A COPY; IT WAS STOLEN FROM MY RECORDS... 

> I'D LIKE YOU TO SHOW ME MY MISSING RECOLLECTION.

### STRAUD ###

> SVETLANA... YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE OF AGE. TO RELIVE THIS SEGMENT OF THE PAST MEANS...

### SVETLANA ###

> YES. EVEN SOMEONE LIKE ME UNDERSTANDS THE PRICE OF JOY.

<i>Later, MANDARC approaches me in the Mansion.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> SO. HOW'D HE TAKE THE NEWS.

### STRAUD ###

> POORLY, MANDARC. POORLY.

### MANDARC ###

> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

### STRAUD ###

> IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S STILL PISSED. AS RIGHT HE SHOULD BE.

### MANDARC ###

> SHE CAME TO YOU; YOU DIDN'T SEEK HER OUT.

> WHAT ELSE WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO?

### STRAUD ###

> I DON'T KNOW, MANDARC.

> I THINK HE WAS JUST ANGRY AT BEING EXCLUDED.

### MANDARC ###

> I DIDN'T GET TO ATTEND EITHER.

> I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THE TIGRESS' FINAL FORM.

### STRAUD ###

> PLEASE DON'T BE OBSCENE.

### MANDARC ###

> SORRY. MY APOLOGIES.

> WHAT WERE HER LAST WORDS?

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT HER CHILDREN, WORRIED THAT SHE'D PLAYED FAVORITES AND THAT THE GIRLS WOULD HOLD A GRUDGE.

### MANDARC ###

> IT ALWAYS DID SEEM TO ME THAT ESTHER WAS HER FAVORITE.

> ALTHOUGH, ISN'T OPHELIA THE MATH GENIUS?

### STRAUD ###

> I'VE NEVER READ OVER THEIR GRADE CARDS.

> ANYWAY. I WOULD EXPECT THE GIRLS, NOW DIVORCED AND WITHOUT A MOTHER IN THE APARTMENT, TO BE THROWING A FAIR AMOUNT OF HOUSE PARTIES.

### MANDARC ###

> OH? WAS SVETLANA A WILD CHILD?

### STRAUD ###

> UNFORTUNATELY. SHE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE SIXTIES DRUG RUSH.

> SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT THE DISCO.

> IT WAS PART OF WHAT DROVE HER AND ERIKSSON APART.

### MANDARC ###

> YEAH, HE SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHT EDGE.

### STRAUD ###

> HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT FOR YOUR ELDERS.

### MANDARC ###

> SORRY, SIR. LOST MYSELF A BIT THERE.

### STRAUD ###

> SHE DID EDUCATE HER DAUGHTERS, THOUGH. ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY, TOO WELL.

> MAYBE THEY WERE TOO YOUNG TO HANDLE THE CROWN.

### MANDARC ###

> WELL IT SEEMS TO BE LESS AN ISSUE THAT THEY WERE -- ARE -- YOUNG

> AND MORE THAT THEY ARE TWINS

> IDENTICAL OR FRATERNAL?

### STRAUD ###

> FRATERNAL, BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL JUST BY APPEARANCE.
