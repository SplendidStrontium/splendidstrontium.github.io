<br/>Dear Tzu,

I hope this letter finds you well. It has been an unseasonably warm spring. Rest assured; you're not missing anything. All predictions are pointing to a warm summer.

I am writing to inform you that my mother has passed on. After many long years, that which we have all feared has happened.

The circumstances by which she died are still somewhat clouded to us. I was out-of-town at the time and the news came in from one of our family friends who was watching the school at the time. I am not sure you have ever met him; his name is Henry -- George Henry. According to his account, which I have no reason to doubt, my mother engaged in a spat with her friend Agnes Sepal. I do not know who fired first or why. When my friends & I were finally able to return to the school, all that was left were her charred bones. The whole thing was terrible. I did not know Agnes well but I had no idea she was capable of such destruction, such brutality. I had thought the two of them were good friends; she'd invited her to stay after coming back from a short stint w/retirement. I truly had no thought that Mother was in such danger by staying with her.

I am sorry that you didn't get to say goodbye to Mother. Please know that she always loved you. You were more than just a student to her. You were like a daughter to her; I always saw you as a sister as well.

Mother will be laid to rest next to her husband in the garden. Please don't feel obligated to visit as I know you keep quite busy these days. Please let me know when you are in town next and I'll let you in to say hello to Mother.
<br/><br/>
