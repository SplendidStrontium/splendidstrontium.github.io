<br/><i>Over the last year, MANDARC SOO has been trying to seek the truth regarding his mysterious past. He has memories of being a child, but believes that he was never born, but was instead created. His former master, the blood mage termed DR McCOY, has demonstrated his faculty with such magics, but the crew has no way of knowing what exactly this process entails, the knowledge having been taboo since time immemorial.</i>

<i>MANDARC has made fast friends with the bionic vampress AVAEL, another former employee of the DOCTOR. She has dedicated her time toward MANDARC's interests, even using her knowledge to obtain information about his origin in [AVAEL 005]({% post_url /fpmc-act-01/2020-12-06-avael-v %}). AVAEL has fashioned herself something of a friend to the youngling.</i>

<i>For at least the past year, MANDARC has been trying to enter DREAMSPACE, otherwise known as "ELYSION". This process could be seen as similar to a human trying to learn how to remain lucid while dreaming. But instead, MANDARC has been plagued with nightmares, such as those he mentions in [CEDRIC 015]({% post_url /fpmc-act-01/2020-12-05-cedric-xv %}).</i>

<I>Except for a short time during which he resided with MYRTLE MARSCAPONE at her Rindle Rose "Retirement Community", ending in [MYRTLE 008]({% post_url /fpmc-act-01/2021-03-02-myrtle-viii %}), MANDARC has been living a life of contentment in the basement apartment of STRAUD MANSION.</i>

<i>Today, MANDARC finds a moment of inner peace. Since reclaiming his stolen dog with the help of his friends, he has enjoyed a quiet summer hiding inside, away from SOL's nearly ever-present glare. The ambient light around his room includes only a few squat candles. He lays on the floor, flipping through a dense text on a tablet computer, the glow illuminating his pale face.</i>

<br/><i>Since the dog DEXX had been retrieved from Saint Louie, he had, without question, taken up residency at STRAUD MANSION. There had been a number of odd adjustments, however. DEXX did not like to reside like MANDARC beneath ground level. He would simply stand at the basement stairs, hanging his tail, resigned to part ways with MANDARC.</I>

<br/><i>MANDARC silently acknowledged that his Master had been more than generous, walking the dog in the daylight hours when the younger had not the energy. VLADISLAUS STRAUD, by some mechanism to which MANDARC was not privy, was able to walk in the sunlight without suffering ill-effect.</i>

<br/><i>MANDARC turns off the tablet to leave the room amongst only the flickering candles. He leaves the darkened tablet on the carpet and raises himself off the floor, using an opposing arm and leg to push himself vertical.</i>

<i>He blows out the candles before exiting the room, shutting the door behind him, as was his habit.</i>

<i>The basement includes a number of convenient amenities: a bar, a kitchen, a sink... it was often down here the Master brought the club when entertaining. He preferred, for whatever reason, to keep the upper levels as they had been long before MANDARC had ever arrived here. It was only in the basement that one might know that they were fully entrenched in the twenti-first century.</i>

<i>The hallway to the stairs is lit by enchanted sconces. He had been instructed that they required no maintenance, and indeed, the candles never dripped wax and the brick wall had no marks of smoke or tar.</i>
