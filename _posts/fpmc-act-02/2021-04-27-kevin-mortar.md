## // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC // ##

<I>It is about 4 AM in the morning when the party arrives at the Marscapone school.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> (thinking) Rain, again.

<i>On the front sidewalk is GEORGE HENRY, carrying in his arms the limp body of SUMMER HOLIDAY.</i>

> (thinking) He's had to drain her memory.

> (thinking) It's for the best.

<i>The CONJURER, DAYWALKER, the MASTER, parallel-park against the curb and climb out of the car.</i>

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> IT'S ABOUT TIME Y'ALL GOT HERE.

<I>The BUTLER follows soon after.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> GEORGE HENRY. THERE WAS A FIRE?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> YOU CAN SMELL IT?

### STRAUD ###

> GET AVAEL OVER HERE. WE'RE GOING TO NEED HER.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>In a few moments, CEDRIC returns to the house with AVAEL.</i>

<i>GEORGE HENRY unlocks the door.</i>

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> I COULDN'T GET THERE IN TIME.

> I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD THE FIRE.

### STRAUD ###

> LAY THE GIRL DOWN. SHE NEEDS SOME REST.

> AND WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> WHERE? WILL SHE BE ABLE TO SLEEP IN THIS ODOR?

### STRAUD ###

> SHE NEEDS REST.

<I>GEORGE HENRY takes SUMMER HOLIDAY upstairs and tucks her into bed. When he returns to the first floor, the party still collects in the dining room.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> WHO WAS IT?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> AGNES. IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN AGNES.

### KEVIN ###

> MY MOTHER'S FRIEND.

### STRAUD ###

> TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> I WAS... I WAS IN THE BASEMENT USING THE COMPUTER WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND.

> I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS JUST THE FIREPLACE AT FIRST SO I TRIED TO PUT IT OUT OF MIND.

> BUT THEN I HEARD THE YELLING. IT WAS HEATED. I FELT SCARED.

> I RUSHED UPSTAIRS. SUMMER WAS AT WORK...

### STRAUD ###

> WHAT WERE YOU WATCHING?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> WHAT, SIR?

### STRAUD ###

> GODDAMN IT! ON THE COMPUTER! WHAT HAD YOU BEEN WATCHING?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> UH... I... UH.

### STRAUD ###

> THINK, MAN, THINK!

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> ONE OF MY RERUNS...

### STRAUD ###

> DAMMIT!

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> OK! OK! 

> IT WAS DISNEY CRAP. UH.

> THE SWORD IN THE STONE.

### STRAUD ###

> SHIT BOY! DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO WATCH THE MOUSE?!

> DID YOUR TIME WITH VINCENT TEACH YOU NOTHING?!

<I>GEORGE HENRY is silent.</i>

> WHERE IS THE OLD WOMAN?

### AVAEL ###

> SHE'S IN THE SUITE.

> BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT OF HER.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> I LEFT THE FIRE TO BURN, JUST AS YOU TOLD --

### STRAUD ###

> SILENCE!

<I>The group, now numbering six, shuffle through the crowded apartment.</i>

> LEAD THE WAY, AVAEL.

<I>They exit the center apartment and make their way into the entryway.</i>

<i>AVAEL lifts her hand and the fingers retract, replaced by a circular saw. She runs a circuit around the door mechanism, leaving just a corner uncut.</i>

<i>She presses on the handle and it falls inside the locked apartment.</i>

<i>The door swings open on its hinges. The creaking is ominous. Inside is a large white piano. Nothing on the first floor seems to be touched. But the smell of ash permiates the space.</i>

<i>Before they ascend the stairs, STRAUD speaks.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> WELL... NO. I KNEW THEY WERE FEUDING, I COULD HEAR THAT MUCH. BUT SHE'D LOCKED THE DOOR. ENCHANTED IT.

### CEDRIC ###

> (whispering) Newb.

### STRAUD ###

> IT IS FOR THE BETTER THAN YOU DID NOT GET INVOLVED IN A WITCHES' SPAT. I AM GLAD YOU ARE SAFE.

### AVAEL ###

> THE BONES ARE UPSTAIRS, MASTER.

### STRAUD ###

> THANK YOU, AVAEL.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> I SHOULD GO CHECK ON...

### AVAEL ###

> LIFESIGNS APPEAR STABLE.

### STRAUD ###

> WELL THERE YOU GO.

<I>They all shuffle upstairs. The second floor is scarred with the remains of fire. Only the tatters of curtains remain on the wall.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> ACTUALLY, CEDRIC.

> GO TEND TO THE YOUNG WOMAN. IT IS BEST SHE REMEMBERS --

<I>But his voice drops as they reach the landing. There is a clatter of charred bones on the floor. It brings down the hearts of the party.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> HOW CAN WE KNOW...

### AVAEL ###

> BIOSIGNS INDICATE THEY ALL BELONG TO THE DECEASED MYRTLE MARSCAPONE.

### STRAUD ###

> GOOD. THAT MAKES OUR JOB EASIER.

> EACH OF YOU TAKE WHAT YOU CAN CARRY. LEAVE THE REST.

<I>A few short minutes later, the group is outside in the garden. They stand in front of a dark, weathered stone.</i>

<center>VINCENT MARSCAPONE</center>

> LAY THEM ATOP THE GRAVE.

<I>Each, in his turn, follows suit. Soon, there is a small heap of blackened bones.</i>

> TAKEN. BEFORE HER TIME.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> SIR. I'M SO SORRY...

### STRAUD ###

> THAT'S ENOUGH, GEORGE. HAVE A LITTLE REVERENCE.

<I>Rain falls gently, coating their hair with a dusting of dew.</i>

<i>MANDARC holds the leash of his dog tight, firm, but the dog does not wince.</i>

<i>They have their heads bowed for an uncountable silence.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?

<I>They lift their heads and peer, uncertain at each other.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> THE MORTAR AND PESTLE. IT'S IN HER KITCHEN. 

> G.H. I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF WHERE IT IS.

<I>GEORGE HENRY looks at KEVIN. 

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> SIR?

### KEVIN ###

> DO AS HE ASKS.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The rain continues to fall. The remains of MYRTLE MARSCAPONE are crushed into the bowl; CEDRIC holds up an umbrella to shield the bowl from the falling water.</i>

<i>Finally they are left with a dark marble cup of grey ash.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> NOW THEN. KEVIN. SUMMON THE WOMAN.

<I>He pauses a second. Unsure. He opens his mouth as if to make an objection but seems to think better of it.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> ...YES.

<I>Unceremoniously, KEVIN grasps a heaping handful of the sticky dust and hurls it over the fence.</i>

<i>GEORGE HENRY leaps in his shoes when appears a gossamer figment of light echoing none other than the MATRON MYRTLE MARSCAPONE.</I>

<I>She doesn't seem to recognize anything around her. She looks around blankly, twirling in her place as if searching for a lost bauble.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> VINCENT?

<I>Her voice is unmistakable. This is the woman's soul stuff.</i>

> VINCENT? WHERE ARE YOU?

<I>She looks around. And suddenly, her face becomes fixated.</i>

<i>On KEVIN.</i>

> KEVIN?

<i>And fiercely,</i>

> WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?

### KEVIN ###

> HE'S NOT HERE, MA.

### MYRTLE ###

> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'HE'S NOT HERE'?

### KEVIN ###

> EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. HE'S NOT HERE.

### MYRTLE ###

> THEN WHERE THE HELL AM I?

> HE PROMISED HE'D MEET ME HERE!

### KEVIN ###

> THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

> HE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE.

> HE SENDS HIS CONDOLENCES.

<I>GEORGE HENRY shifts uneasily.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> KEVIN...

### KEVIN ###

> KEVIN NOTHING.

<I>What little able to be gleaned from her transparent face melts into shock, fear, remorse. She looks around and her eyes settle upon the figures around her.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> VLAD? CEDRIC?

<I>And with a spit of contention -- </i>

### MYRTLE ###

> ...MANDARC?!

### STRAUD ###

> WE'RE ALL HERE.

### MYRTLE ###

> (pleading) IT... IT WAS AGNES! SHE FIRED FLAME UPON ME!

### CEDRIC ###

> WE CAN SEE THAT. THE SCHOOL IS SMOULDERING.

### MYRTLE ###

> (with bile) IT... IT WAS YOU!

<I>She points at GEORGE HENRY.</I>

> YOU WERE PLAYING THAT... THAT STUPID SONG!

### STRAUD ###

> THAT "STUPID SONG" SAVED YOUR LIFE. AND BESIDES.

> THE YOUNG ACOLYTE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

### MYRTLE ###

> 'SAVED MY LIFE'?!

> LOOK AT ME!

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S NOT SO BAD. YOUR HAIR LOOKS GREAT.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The five are in the kitchen, silently reflecting on what to do, where to go next.</i>

<i>MYRTLE's ghost has dissolved, but she will be back, they are sure. Once a spirit has been bound to a place, it never truly disappears.</i>

<i>A rush of water through pipes becomes audible.</i>

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> IT'S SUMMER. SHE'S JUST WAKING UP, IT SOUNDS LIKE.

<I>In a few minutes, the sliding door opens. In walks a young woman with her hair restrained in a tight French braid, just barely untidy from fitfull sleep.</i>

### SUMMER HOLIDAY ###

> GEORGE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

> WHAT HAPPENED?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> MY MOTHER DIED.

<I>She brings her hands to her face, gasping.</i>

### SUMMER HOLIDAY ###

> OH NO, GEORGE! THAT'S TERRIBLE!

### GEORGE ###

> THESE ARE MY BROTHERS. AND MY DAD.

<I>He waves toward the silver-haired gentleman VLADISLAUS STRAUD.</I>

<I>She reaches out her hand.</i>

### SUMMER HOLIDAY ###

> MISTER MARSCAPONE. I'M SO SORRY.

### STRAUD ###

> WELL, ACTUALLY, WE WERE DIVORCED.

> BUT IT'S OF NO MATTER.

> VLADISLAUS STRAUD.

<I>SUMMER HOLIDAY tries to say the name but it's a mouthful and she mispronounces it.</i>

<i>STRAUD says his name again.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> VLADISLAUS STRAUD.

### SUMMER HOLIDAY ###

> MISTER STRAUD. IT'S NICE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

> YOUR SON HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN A GENTLEMAN.

<I>She turns toward GEORGE HENRY.</I>

> YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD BROTHERS!

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> IT NEVER CAME UP.

### SUMMER HOLIDAY ###

> I'M AN ONLY CHILD, MYSELF.

> BUT I ALWAYS WANTED SIBLINGS.

<I>A knock interrupts their conversation.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> I'LL GET IT.

<I>KEVIN goes to the front door of the MAGICADEMY and opens it.</i>

<i>It's LARRY.</I>

### KEVIN ###

> (irritated) LARRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I'M... I'M LOOKING FOR --

### KEVIN ###

> LARRY, SHE'S DIED.

<I>His face drops in shock.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'SHE'S DIED'?

### KEVIN ###

> WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'WHAT DO I MEAN'? 

> EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

> SHE HAS DIED.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT WHAT ABOUT HER POTION?

### KEVIN ###

> SHE NEVER FINISHED HER RESEARCH. SHE RAN OUT OF TIME.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT... THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO!

### KEVIN ###

> EXCUSE ME?

<I>The sound of laughter comes from inside the house.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> CAN'T YOU CAST A RESURRECTION FOR HER?

### KEVIN ###

> CAST RESURRECTION?

> POTTER.

> THIS AIN'T FUCKIN' ... DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.

> NO, I CANNOT SIMPLY CAST RESURRECTION.

> HER BONES WERE BURNT TO A CRISP.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BURNT TO A CRISP? YOU DON'T MEAN...

### KEVIN ###

> YES. THERE WAS A FIRE.

> IT SEEMS SHE WAS SMOKING IN THE BEDROOM AND A FIRE STARTED.

> SHE PROBABLY THREW HER CIGARETTE BUTT IN THE GARBAGE OR SOMETHING.

> SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT... HASN'T THE SCHOOL GOT SPRINKLERS?

### KEVIN ###

> IT SEEMS SHE'D DISABLED THE ONES IN HER BEDROOM. 

> LISTEN, POTTER. I REALLY HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME TO PLAY TWENTY QUESTIONS WITH YOU. STRAUD'S HERE AND I'M GOING TO HELP HIM PERFORM THE RITES.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> DO YOU NEED A THIRD?

### KEVIN ###

> LARRY. HAVE YOU FOUND HERMIONE YET?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WELL, NO. NOT YET.

<I>KEVIN grits his teeth.

### KEVIN ###

> THEN. WHY. DON'T. YOU. WORK. ON. THAT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I WAS GOING TO HELP THE HEADMISTRESS GO THROUGH HER BOOKS.

### KEVIN ###

> WELL YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE, AIN'T YA.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> YEAH... I GUESS SO.

### KEVIN ###

> OK LARRY. I GOTTA GO.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

### KEVIN ###

> YEAH, ME TOO.

> LISTEN.

> COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> SURE... ANYTHING.

### KEVIN ###

> I NEED YOU TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF CASSANDRA GOTH AND LET HER KNOW THAT MY MOTHER IS DEAD.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> CASSANDRA GOTH?

### KEVIN ###

> YES. IT'S LESS HER THAT NEEDS TO KNOW, BUT IN PARTICULAR THE YOUNG LUCIA EKSTROM STAYING WITH HER.

> SHE'S A NORTHERN PRINCESS WHO WAS SEEKING MY MOTHER'S MENTORSHIP.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> SHIT. A NORTHERN PRINCESS?

### KEVIN ###

> YES. AND PLEASE.

> TRY NOT TO HUMILIATE YOURSELF.

<I>KEVIN shuts the door. But LARRY POTTER continues speaking. Muted by the door, KEVIN can still hear him speaking.</i>

### LARRY POTTER ###

> WHERE AM I GOING? DO YOU HAVE --

<I>KEVIN yanks the door open.</i>

> AN ADDRESS?

### KEVIN ###

> 37 ASCOT.

### LARRY POTTER ###

> BUT WHERE...

### KEVIN ###

> YOU DON'T HAVE A PHONE?

### LARRY POTTER ###

> I DO, BUT --

### KEVIN ###

> PUNCH IT INTO YOUR G.P.S. OR WHATEVER. I'M SURE YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT. 

> GOODBYE, LARRY.
