<P style="text-decoration: underline;">| Trelaine's Pro-tips </p>

* don't take hissing trait if you intend to be doctoring
* for that matter, any of the go-to-work professions
* "lazy" is like "elder" for physical activity
* vampire dueling aspiration (master) doesn't need to be different people, just fights
* plantain trees don't grow in Oasis Springs (poor Tzu)
* neither does parsley
* "tetris" is when you clear 4 lines at once with the long straight block
* complete spellcasting aspirations early; they're easy
* plentiful needs potion satisfies some thirst
* be careful when setting your club activities - they actually do it
* beware free roughhousing - a dazed sim can't do much for you
* pac-ghosts look in the direction they're going to travel
* economize action-time by reducing pausing; set a travel point at speed 1 instead of going for the object first
* stretch during loading screens
* a pizza is $25 and makes great leftovers
* hottub is underpowered
