<br><i>The MARSCAPONE AUXILIARY APARTMENTS are quiet. KEVIN's car has already parked in the driveway. I have the lightest feeling of dread.</i>

<i>I alert the denizens to my presence.</i>

<i>AVAEL answers the door.</i>

#### AVAEL

> EVENING, MASTER. PLEASE, ENTER.
> 
> THE TRIO IS DOWNSTAIRS ATTENDING TO OUR GUEST.

<BR><I>She moves aside to allow me entrance.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THANK YOU, AVAEL.

<BR><I>In the basement of the townhome is a small holding cell used in the time of VINCENT MARSCAPONE. Long ago an array of silvered bars had been placed to hold creatures of supernatural strength.</i>

<i>I enter CEDRIC's apartment and walk down the stairs into the damp basement.</i>

<i>I can hear the trio talking amongst themselves.</i>

#### ROXANNE

> HOW LONG UNTIL SHE COMES TO?

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
> 
> I'M SURPRISED THE SERUMS WORKED ON HER AT ALL.

#### STRAUD

> SHE'S WEAKENED.

<BR><I>The three look back toward me but wait for me to finish descending the stairs. They're on the other side of the first set of bars, in the interrogation seat.</I>

#### STRAUD

> SHE'S A GODDESS. OR AT LEAST, APPARENTLY, SHE <U>WAS</U>.
> 
> HER KIND RELIES ON WORSHIP FOR THEIR POWER.

#### ROXANNE

> WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ONE OF THE CONDUITS.

#### STRAUD

> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
> 
> SHE IS SOURCED FROM SOMETHING ELSE.
> 
> THAT IS, IF SHE IS WHO SHE CLAIMS TO BE.

<BR><I>I step forward and the three allow me to observe the prisoner.</i>

<i>They've lain her on the bed. She lays still with her eyes closed.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IF SHE WERE AT FULL STRENGTH, YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT YOUR SERUMS TO HAVE ANY EFFECT.
> 
> BUT SHE LIKELY HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM A LOSS OF WORSHIP. THAT'S WHY WE SEE HER HERE.

#### ROXANNE

> WHY WAS SHE AT THE GOTH'S?

#### STRAUD

> WE'LL HAVE TO ASK HER WHEN SHE RISES.
> 
> HAS SHE SPOKEN?

#### KEVIN

> VERY LITTLE.
> 
> SHE DID TELL US HER NAME, OBVIOUSLY. AND LAMENTED THAT HER NAME DIDN'T MEAN MUCH, WHICH I SUPPOSE MEANT HER LACK OF FOLLOWERS.

<BR><I>I change the subject.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> HOW ARE YOU, ROXANNE?

<BR><I>She stood holding her arm with the opposite hand.</i>

#### ROXANNE

> I'M DOING OKAY. JUST... EMBARRASSED I GOT CAUGHT BY HER.
> 
> IT WAS HURTING A LOT, BUT IT'S GETTING BETTER NOW.

<BR>
