<p class="ppl-sez">I was on a boat, a bathroom. Going to take a shower.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was a big fancy boat, like something of a hotel.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Before I could get to the water to turn it on, water started pouring in through the sides of the room. Rapid, fast, like nothing I could hope to control.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">My daughter came to me.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Mommy!" she cried.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I held her fast and cradled her, knowing the end was upon us.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I feared the drowning, but stood my ground, knowing I had to be strong for her.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It's going to be... okay." and I smoothed her hair, trying to reassure her in light of the inevitable.</p>

<br><i>of snow and winter shoes upon the rubberized flooring. Everyone's bundled up inside thick coats. A mid-aged woman catches his attention with a realistic line of faux-fur detailing her hood.</i>

<br><i>Finally he arrives at his intended bus stop. But he's not sure whether he really wants to disembark or if he'd prefer to linger on the bus, people-watching while bound for destinations unknown.</i>

<i>But he has a schedule, and promise, to keep.</i>

### // ZHOU HOUSE //

<br><center>[ KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. ]</center>

<br><i>This time it's Seven who answers the door.</i>

#### SEVEN

> HI CEDRIC!
> 
> WELCOME WELCOME.
> 
> PLEASE COME IN.

<BR><I>Cedric kicks snow from his shoes and steps into the warm house.</i>

#### SEVEN

> IS IT REALLY TRUE, WHAT THEY SAY?
> 
> THAT VAMPIRES CAN'T GO INTO A HOUSE UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN INVITED?

<br><i>It did seem the little tyke loved her lore.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME.

<BR><I>They leave the sheltered porch and enter the proper house, Cedric now having removed his shoes.</i>

#### SEVEN

> YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING.
> 
> 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW --
> 
> IT'S NOT LIKE DAD INVITED IN THE VAMPIRES WHO ATTACKED US.
> 
> WE WERE IN A HOUSE.
> 
> WASN'T OUR HOUSE, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T MATTER, SHOULD IT?

#### CEDRIC

> LIKE I SAID, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU READ IN BOOKS.
> 
> THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY UNTRUE, BUT MUST BE READ IN THEIR OWN CONTEXT.

#### SEVEN 

> I HAVE A COPY HERE.

#### CEDRIC

> ...
> 
> OF COURSE YOU DO.

<BR><I>Seven walks toward a stately bookshelf and pulls down a small book, decorated throughout with colorful sticky-notes.</i>

<i>She flips through the tabs.</i>

#### SEVEN

> ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
> 
> CHAPTER 18. MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL.

<BR><I>She mumbles to herself while glancing through the words.</i>

#### SEVEN

> "NECROMANCY"...
> 
> "STORM", "FOG", "THUNDER"...
> 
> BLAH BLAH BLAH...
> 
> DO YOU EVER FIND IT DIFFICULT TO READ SOME OF THESE LONG PARAGRAPHS?

<BR><I>Cedric raises his eyebrow to her.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> AT... TIMES.

<BR><I>She returns to her well-worn book.</i>

#### SEVEN

> NEVER DID HE EAT...
> 
> "MIST", "MOONLIGHT"...
> 
> AHA!!

<BR><I>Seven points to the passage and scoots next to Cedric, positioning the book so that he may, if he desires, read along with her as she speaks aloud.</i>

#### SEVEN 

> "HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS, YET HE IS NOT FREE."
> 
> YADDA YADDA...
> 
> "HE MAY NOT ENTER ANYWHERE AT THE FIRST, UNLESS THERE BE SOME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO BID HIM TO COME; THOUGH AFTERWARDS HE CAN COME AS HE PLEASE."

<BR><I>At the conclusion of the reading, he stands up straight. He's considerably taller than Seven; a vampire permanently imprisoned in the body of a ten-year-old girl.</i>

<i>Taking the right of a convert to be fully expressed in their own body is taboo in their circle; Straud has expressly forbidden it, stating he would personally exact a vengeance worse than death. </i>

#### CEDRIC

> NOTE THE WORD VAN HELSING USES --
> 
> "HE".
> 
> HE'S REFERRING TO DRACULA.
> 
> THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THAT NOT ALL VAMPIRES ARE ALIKE.
> 
> JUST LIKE ALL HUMANS AREN'T ALIKE.
> 
> NOW, I NEVER MET DRACULA OR VAN HELSING SO LET'S JUST ASSUME WE HAVE A TRUSTWORTHY NARRATOR HERE AND NOT A COMPLETE WORK OF FICTION, BUT --
> 
> THESE LIMITATIONS ARE CONNECTED TO HIM.
> 
> LIKELY HIS LINE AS WELL, BUT THAT'S NO GUARANTEE.
> 
> LET'S JUST ASSUME THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO HIM AND ONLY HIM.

#### SEVEN

> DOES THAT MEAN THE BENEFITS AREN'T UNILATERALLY APPLIED EITHER?

#### CEDRIC

> "BENEFITS"?

<BR><I>She turns back to her reference material.</i>

#### SEVEN

> "HE CAN, WITHIN LIMITATIONS, APPEAR AT WILL WHEN, AND WHERE, AND IN ANY OF THE FORMS THAT ARE TO HIM"...
> 
> "HE CAN GROW AND BECOME SMALL; AND HE CAN AT TIMES VANISH AND COME UNKNOWN."

#### CEDRIC

> YOU MEAN THE SHAPESHIFTING.
> 
> ...WELL.
> 
> THAT'S KIND OF THE TRICKY PART, ISN'T IT?
> 
> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHETHER SOMETHING IS TRULY IMPOSSIBLE, OR YOU SIMPLY HAVEN'T LEARNED IT YET.

#### SEVEN

> CAN YOU DO IT?
> 
> WALK AS MIST?

<BR><I>He blinks slowly, a number of unwelcome memories flooding back to his waking thoughts.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> ...
> 
> YES. 
> 
> I CAN.

<BR><I>Her face brightens and she laughs, triumphant.</i>

#### SEVEN

> THAT. IS. SO. COOL!
> 
> WOW.
> 
> JUST WAIT UNTIL THE GIRLS HEAR THIS!
> 
> I'M SO GLAD PAPA BROUGHT US HERE.

<BR><I>Cedric does not rise to meet her enthusiasm. He takes this opportunity to change the subject.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I TAKE IT YOUR FATHER HAS HAD YOU TRAVELING AROUND A LOT.

<BR><I>Seven puts her book back on the shelf.</i>

#### SEVEN

> YEAH, WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.
> 
> CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE DONE FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH GRADE.
> 
> WE GO SOMEWHERE NEW WHENEVER PEOPLE START ACTING FUNNY.
> 
> DAD'S REAL GOOD AT FAKING PAPERWORK.
> 
> HE'S HAD A LOT OF PRACTICE.

#### CEDRIC

> I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE ABLE TO BE ACTIVE DURING THE DAY.

#### SEVEN

> YEAH, IT USED TO BE WORSE FOR US, BUT IT'S GOT EASIER AS TIME'S GONE ON.
> 
> I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, THE PROBLEMS LESSEN WITH TIME.

#### CEDRIC

> AGE.
> 
> THE WORD YOU WANT IS AGE.

<BR><I>SEVEN pauses, seeming unaccustomed to being corrected in this way.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> BUT IT'S TRUE; THE WEAKNESSES THAT CONFINE A FLEDGLING TO THEIR COFFIN WILL DECREASE OVER TIME.
> 
> BUT THEY NEVER TRULY GO AWAY.

#### SEVEN

> OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE.
> 
> I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE CHILDREN.
> 
> I CAN GO TO SCHOOL BUT DAMN IF I'M NOT TIRED ALL. DAMN. DAY.
> 
> ARE YOU LIKE THAT TOO? I NOTICE YOU ONLY COME OUT AFTER DARK.

#### CEDRIC

> TWICE IS COINCIDENCE.

#### SEVEN 

> AND THREE TIMES MAKES A PATTERN.

#### CEDRIC

> ENEMY ACTION. 
> 
> THREE TIMES IS ENEMY ACTION.
> 
> IAN FLEMING. GOLDFINGER.
> 
> ...
> 
> WHERE IS EVERYONE?

#### SEVEN

> PAPA IS PROBABLY UPSTAIRS. PENNY AND ALYSON ARE DOWNSTAIRS, I'M SURE.
> 
> THAT'S WHERE OUR COMPUTERS ARE.

#### CEDRIC

> IS IT STRICTLY REQUIRED THAT YOU ATTEND SCHOOL?

#### SEVEN

> TELL ME ABOUT IT!!
> 
> I KEEP TELLING PAPA THAT WE LIVE IN THE BIG CITY NOW AND NO ONE WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT SEEING A CHILD IN HER HOUSE DURING THE DAY BUT HE WON'T LISTEN.
> 
> MAYBE YOU CAN CONVINCE HIM.

#### CEDRIC

> SCHOOL IS A RISK I'M UNWILLING TO TAKE.

#### SEVEN

> AND IF I HAVE TO READ 'NUMBER THE STARS' ONE MORE TIME I JUST MIGHT SCREAM.
> 
> I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD BOOK AND ALL BUT O.M.G.!
> 
> THAT AND 'HOLES'.
> 
> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSIGN 'HOLES'?!

#### CEDRIC

> ...
> 
> NO, I DON'T.

<BR><I>Seven retreats in embarrassment.</i>

#### SEVEN

> SORRY.
> 
> BUT I AGREE. I THINK IT'S SILLY TO KEEP SENDING US TO SCHOOL.
> 
> ...MAYBE WE COULD DO HOME-SCHOOL?

#### CEDRIC

> I'LL TALK TO YOUR FATHER. 

#### SEVEN

> OH, I'LL TALK TO HIM.
> 
> I MEAN, YOU CAN TALK TO HIM IF YOU WANT.
> 
> I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'LL HELP.
