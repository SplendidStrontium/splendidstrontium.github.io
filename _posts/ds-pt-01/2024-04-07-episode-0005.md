> AND NOW IT WILL BE OVER.

> FEAR WOULD BE ENDED, AND SO WOULD HOPE.

<p>Vicki is packing her bags to leave for NYC. She's had it, after a night of senseless interrogation and sleep punctuated by ghostly wailing, she's ready to head back to NYC. But Carolyn won't have it.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-02.jpg" />

#### CAROLYN 

> VICTORIA WINTERS. 
> 
> YOU'RE QUITTING, AREN'T YOU?

#### VICTORIA 

> UH-HUH.

#### CAROLYN 

> BUT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE ONE NIGHT!

#### VICTORIA 

> WELL, IT SEEMS I CAN'T TAKE IT.

#### CAROLYN 

> AND HERE I THOUGHT I'D FOUND A FRIEND.
> 
> ...
> 
> OH VICKI I KNOW IT WAS ROUGH LAST NIGHT BUT..
> 
> NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN I.

#### VICTORIA 

> WELL, I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT COFFEE.

<p>And we're well set up for a good rapport between the two young women. They go off for their coffee.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-03.jpg" />

<p>David comes creeping out of the room (where does he learn it from, his father?) and goes to Victoria's room. </p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-04.jpg" />

<p>Suspenseful music plays and we're sure something bad is going to happen. Vicki's only been here one night and already he feels out of place here. He shouldn't be here. He even goes to the window and I'm thinking he's going to jump -- and then --</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-05.jpg" />

<p>He calls out for Mother. Surely any boy would yearn for his mother -- who is assuredly <u>not</u> dead as we found out last episode. He vandalizes the suitcase and we cut back to Carolyn and Victoria, who is relaying the 2 AM incident where she met David.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-06.jpg" />

<p>Victoria relays that she heard sobbing last night and Carolyn is incredulous but also refuses to validate Vicki's experience. She responds with a cold, "Maybe you were dreaming."</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-07.jpg" />

<p>Roger comes in and kisses Carolyn, to which she responds "Delicious!" ...Eyuck. Maybe it's just rich people things. </p>

<p>He presents a letter for Vicki from home and the only thing I can think of is WOW -- The post gets there fast. Overnight letters. I'm impressed. Also, the mail go there at 8 AM or whatever ungodly hour of morning it is. Hard-working post office there in Collinsport.</p>

<p>Roger says he hasn't seen David, but doesn't seem worried. "If you see him," he continues, "give him a kick for me, will you? There's a good girl." Oh boy. With fathers like these...</p>

<p>Vicki asked Roger if he heard any sobbing last night.</p>

#### ROGER 

> DREAMS, MISS WINTERS.
> 
> NOTHING BUT DREAMS.
> 
> HAPPY BREAKFAST!

#### CAROLYN 

> YOU SEE, VICKI?
> 
> ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE US JUST 'CAUSE OF A DREAM?

<p>Vicki sighs, as well she should, because the even the music is hinting to us that everyone's playing her as a fool.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-08.jpg" />

<p>Upstairs, David furiously goes through her room packing her things. Poor Vicki didn't bring much, really, for starting her life anew in Collinsport.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-09.jpg" />

<p>In the miraculous fastest letter delivered ever:</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS, ANYTHING IMPORTANT?

#### VICTORIA 

> JUST NEWS.
> 
> SHE SAYS ALL THE CHILDREN MISS ME.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-10.jpg" />

#### VICTORIA 
 
> WELL, I'LL JUST HAVE TIME FOR A GOOD LONG LOOK AT THE VIEW BEFORE I GO UPSTAIRS AND GET PACKED.

#### CAROLYN 

> YOU'RE CHICKEN.

#### VICTORIA 

> I SUPPOSE I AM.

<p>The pair share a tearful moment when Vicki starts in with the hard questions.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-11.jpg" />

#### VICTORIA 

> CAROLYN, IF YOU HATE IT HERE SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-12.jpg" />

<p>She responds with a thoughtless line, one that I'm sure won't be her last.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> OH, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

#### VICTORIA 

> OH, DON'T ENVY ME.

#### CAROLYN 

> WHY NOT?
> 
> WHEN YOU CAN JUST PICK UP YOUR BAG AND WALK OUT OF HERE.
> 
> YOU GO HOME TO A NORMAL FAMILY --

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-13.jpg" />

<p>But Vicki takes the wind out of her sails when she reveals the letter came from a foundling home.</p>

#### VICTORIA 

> THAT'S RIGHT, I'M ONE OF THOSE KIDS.

<p>She continues, describing the letter that was left with her when she was abandoned. "Her name is Victoria. I cannot take care of her." She describes the conditions of her abandonment, including that $50 came for her each month postmarked from Bangor, Maine, noting that Collinsport is only fifty miles from Bangor.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> OH, VICKI, THAT'S A REAL STRETCH.

#### VICTORIA 

> WHEN YOU'RE AS DESPERATE AS I AM, YOU GRAB FOR ANYTHING.
> 
> SO DON'T EVER ENVY ME -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND YOU BELONG. 
> 
> AND YOUR NAME IS MORE THAN JUST A SEASON WHEN YOU WERE DROPPED ON THE MOST CONVENIENT DOORSTEP.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-14.jpg" />

<p>Upstairs, David continues to rifle through Victoria's things. Was he hoping to get a few bucks from her purse?</p>

<p>He looks out the window and sees Victoria heading toward the promontory, getting that last big breath of ocean air before heading upstairs.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-15.jpg" />

<p>A mysterious man appears that I don't recognize from my post-Barnabas viewings. I suppose he was recast?</p>

#### VICTORIA 

> WHO ARE YOU?

#### SAM 

> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
> 
> ONE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ALL MY LIFE.
> 
> WHO AM I?
> 
> WHO ARE ANY OF US?
> 
> WHY ARE WE HERE IN THIS GREEN AND UGLY WORLD?
> 
> YOUR NAME IS VICTORIA WINTERS.

#### VICTORIA 

> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

#### SAM 

> WHEN A MAN HAS CRUISED ALONG THESE CLIFFS AS LONG AS I HAVE, AND GAZED OUT TO SEA, FEASTED HIS EYES ON THE BEAUTY HERE, FASTENED HIS EARS TO THE KEYHOLES BESIDE, HE LEARNS A GREAT DEAL.

<p>Sam Evans reveals he knows a lot about her. All he wants is for her to tell Roger that "Sam wandered along the shore last night and came to Widow's Hill this morning". He additionally wants her to tell that to no one else in that "ghost-ridden house of tears".</p>

<p>He continues, relaying the tale of Josette Collins, saying that everyone despised her because she was different, a stranger. He adds, "even the house hated her." Could he be trying to make a comparison between Josette and our heroine here?</p>

<p>Curiously, when Victoria is asked whether she believes in ghosts, she refuses her own experience, echoing what Roger and Carolyn have said to her this morning. Sam compares Elizabeth to a ghost, and it certainly opens up some lines of thought.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-16.jpg" />

<p>By the way, this room is a new set for me and I really like it. It's bright and modern, unlike the rest of the house.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-17.jpg" />

<p>Was it common to iron in the breakfast room? At any rate, it provides a distraction for Carolyn in the coming scene.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-18.jpg" />

<p>The two talk about Elizabeth. Victoria had been shocked to learn from Sam that Carolyn's mother hasn't been off the hill in eighteen years.</p>

#### VICTORIA 

> WHY DID SHE DO IT?

#### CAROLYN 

> BECAUSE OF MY DAD. 
> 
> HE LEFT, YOU KNOW. 
> 
> TOOK OFF.
> 
> EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO AND MY MOTHER, BEING A SENSIBLE WOMAN, DID THE NATURAL THING.
> 
> SHE DECIDED TO WAIT FOR HIM.
> 
> AND WHERE DO YOU WAIT?
> 
> AT THE HOUSE.
> 
> LOGICAL, ISN'T IT?

<p>Such a sad story, if it's true. Vicki leaves to go upstairs and pack her things.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-19.jpg" />

<p>Vicki is almost there when gosh darnit Carolyn shows up again. She shares her conspiracy theory that there may be a connection between the two of them because of that shared time frame: eighteen years. Vicki doesn't think much of it, and to be honest neither do I. But time will tell.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-20.jpg" />

<p>Vicki goes into her room and we find that David has found Vicki's letter and cruelly quotes it back to her while keeping it from her before crumpling it. The audience is shocked and outraged until David reveals that it's the "widows" who "told me to send you home". Oh dear, David is being haunted! That would certainly explain a lot.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-21.jpg" />

<p>Vicki meditates a moment on what's happened before Carolyn comes in. She is not too shocked to find what David has done.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-22.jpg" />

#### VICTORIA 

> IF I GO, THEN ALL I HAVE IS THIS.

#### CAROLYN 

> MAYBE YOU'LL THINK OF ANOTHER ANGLE SOMEDAY.

#### VICTORIA 

> YES, MAYBE I WILL.
> 
> ...
> 
> CAROLYN; HELP ME PUT THOSE THINGS AWAY, I'M GOING TO STAY.

#### CAROLYN 

> YOU BET!

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0005-23.jpg" />

<p>I really enjoyed this episode and thought it was well-composed. We learned a lot about some major players, and the plot was moved forward. And of course, Vicki has decided to stay at Collinsport. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>★★★★</p>
