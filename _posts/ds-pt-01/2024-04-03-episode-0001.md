#### VICTORIA 

> MY NAME IS VICTORIA WINTERS.

>
> A JOURNEY THAT WILL BRING ME TO A STRANGE AND DARK PLACE.
>

> PEOPLE WHO TONIGHT ARE STILL ONLY SHADOWS IN MY MIND.
>
> BUT WILL SOON FILL THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF MY TOMORROWS.

<p>Episode 1 opens with a hallmark speech from Victoria eagerly awaiting her arrival in Collinwood. It transfers quickly to what will become a staple for the show, an argument between Elizabeth and Roger over a glass of brandy. I advise you to avoid a drinking game based on how often the characters in the show indulge. </p>

<p>Roger doubts the necessity of having Victoria at all. He has a deeply sarcastic tone when referring to his son and it's really too bad. I don't remember David being all that bad. Of course, with a father like Roger...</p>

#### ROGER 

> WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE DOORS AND LET THE WHOLE TOWN COME TROUPING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND HAVE DONE WITH IT?

#### ELIZABETH

> THE GIRL WILL STAY.

<p>Roger soon after breaks his glass and then the show's theme is played for the first time. I assume Roger was not the one tasked with cleaning the glass up off the floor. Roger is perfectly detestable, a delightfully sour companion to his sister, Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Now I've become a fan by watching the usual run of episodes that start with Barnabas's release from the coffin, so I admit I'm already familiar with most of the characters shown in this episode. But we're far from that here. But it's a joy to start with Victoria. It is revealed that Victoria was offered the job by Elizabeth Stoddard without knowing who she is. How did Elizabeth find out about Victoria, being that Victoria is basically a nobody, an orphan who lived far away in NYC?</p>

#### BURKE

> WELCOME TO THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE WORLD, MS. WINTERS.

<p>Burke Devlin is introduced, and judging by the music that's being played while he's on screen, he's meant to be a shady character. (No, Victoria, don't get into that car with him!) He has apparently been to Collinsport before but not in a long time. Why did he leave? What is his intention upon returning?</p>

<p>The innkeeper tries to invoke in Burke any feelings of familiarity, even going in for a hug, saying he knew him since he was a child but he is rebuked, Burke saying that he doesn't remember anything. Does he truly not remember anything or is he just a cold fish? Curious gets curiouser.</p>

<p>Who is this mysterious smoking man? Friend to Burke Devlin, so we know we can't like him. Also he shamelessly lights up in this tiny bar. I guess I'll have to get over my modern sensibilities with this one; it was just a product of the time. It's amazing how clear the smoke comes through on the camera despite the picture quality. Burke wants every bit of intel he can get on the Collins family. But why? Who is Burke? What does he want?</p>

<p>"Roast beef, rare, and coffee." Maggie Evans is soon after introduced and the first thing that stands out to me is her hair. A blonde, huh? Her eyebrows give away that it's a dye-job. Or a wig. Probably a wig. She loves to be a gossip. But she's friendly and I immediately like her. She offers some apple pie to Victoria, and she won't take no for an answer!</p>

<p>Victoria goes into a flashback, and she's shown talking to her friend Sandy("hey that's my slip you're packing!"), who attempts a NY accent. Victoria seems almost compelled to go to Collinwood, not as if she's really going of her own volition. I would venture to guess that something is pulling her there. We all know Collinwood has a strange gravity that attracts the supernatural.</p>

#### VICTORIA 

> I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO.
> 
> BUT I HAVE TO.

<p>Maggie advises Victoria to stay at the inn a night a think it over, but Victoria says she intends to do just what she set out to do -- and that is go to Collinwood.</p>

<p>For the ending theme, we are gifted this great shot of the entry to Collinwood, a set we will be enjoying often over the coming 1225 episodes. Many of the best scenes start here and transfer over to the drawing room. Overall I found this a great first episode, suspense was built up around Collinwood and Victoria's arrival and I can't wait to see more of the characters.</p>

<p>★★★☆</p>
