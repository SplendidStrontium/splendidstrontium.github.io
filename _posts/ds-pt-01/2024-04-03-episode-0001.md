<br><p>Episode 1 opens with a hallmark speech from Victoria eagerly awaiting her arrival in Collinwood. It transfers quickly to what will become a staple for the show, an argument between Elizabeth and Roger. Roger doubts the necessity of having Victoria at all. </p>

#### ROGER 

> WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE DOORS AND LET THE WHOLE TOWN COME TROUPING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND BE DONE WITH IT?

<br><p>Roger breaks his glass and then the show's theme is played for the first time. </p>

<p>Now I've become a fan by watching the usual run of episodes that start with Barnabas's release from the coffin. But we're far from that here. It is revealed that Victoria was offered the job by Elizabeth Stoddard without knowing who she is.</p>

<p>Burke Devlin is introduced, and judging by the music that's being played, he's meant to be a shady character. (No, Victoria, don't get into that car with him!)</p>

<p>Maggie Evans is soon after introduced and the first thing that stands out to me is her hair. A blonde, huh? She loves to be a gossip. But she's friendly and I immediately like her. She offers some apple pie to Victoria, and she won't take no for an answer!</p>

<p>Victoria goes into a flashback, and she's shown talking to her friend Sandy, who attempts a NY accent. She seems almost compelled to go to Collinwood, and doesn't seem as if she's really going of her own volition. I would venture to guess that something is pulling her there.</p>

<p>Maggie advises Victoria to stay at the inn a night a think it over, but Victoria says she intends to do just what she set out to do -- and that is go to Collinwood.</p>

<p>Overall I found this a great first episode, suspense was built up around Collinwood and Victoria's arrival there and I can't wait to see more of the characters.</p>

<p>★★★☆</p>
