<p>More presumably paranormal activity at the window; I daresay there isn't a normal wind that blows through the windows of Collinwood. Vicki thinks nothing of it, but she will soon come to be aware. Unbeknownst to her, a mysterious figure walks through the house, stalking toward Vicki's room. Who could it be?</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-02.jpg" />

<p>Oh dash it all, Elizabeth helps us out and reveals that it's just Roger being creepy. I mean, seriously, how is this dude thought to be so charming by everyone when he's really turning out to be a jerk and a creep. Thanks Elizabeth, we owe you one for looking out for Vicki.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-03.jpg" />

<p>Creepy old Roger has yet another drink, although presumably that will not help quell his desire to creep around the house stalking the new girl. He shares with Elizabeth that Burke Devlin is back in town. Intel spreads fast in this town, it's hard to believe that all of this so far is said to have happened in a single night. And it was already dark when Vicki was on the train!</p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND BURKE DEVLIN WAS FINISHED TEN YEARS AGO.

<p>But what happened? We still don't know. And apparently someone thinks this isn't finished business. Whatever it is, it's serious enough that Roger claims Burke will "destroy" him, and perhaps even kill him. Oh Roger, what have you got yourself into?</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-04.jpg" />

<p>Now here's what I call the "kitten" scene. I dare you to take a drink for every time Roger calls Carolyn "kitten". Go on, I dare you. The three talk for a little bit and then Roger insists on bringing V.W. back into this scene. Geez, just let the lady get a little sleep why don't you? What is it at this point, eleven? Midnight? Does anyone sleep in this house? Roger gives Carolyn a chaste kiss, but a kiss nonetheless. I'm watching you, Roger.</p>

#### ROGER 

> BELIEVE ME, KITTEN, ALL I WANT TO DO IS ASK HER A FEW QUESTIONS.

<p>Carolyn leaves to fetch V.W. and not let her get any sleep. </p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> LOOK AT THEM ALL LINED UP ON THE WALL.
> 
> ISAAC COLLINS, JEREMIAH COLLINS, THEODORE, BENJAMIN!
> 
> HOW WOULD THEY HAVE HANDLED THIS PROBLEM?

<p>But Roger, determined to make his own way in the world, says that he's not any of them and that he's going to fight his own way. ("I did it my way".)</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-06.jpg" />

<p>Upstairs, Carolyn is wracked with guilt about Vicki even possibly entertaining a negative idea about Roger. She's definitely his best advocate here.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> HE'S REALLY A VERY NICE GUY, VICKI, BUT HE'S HAD A ROUGH TIME. 
> 
> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW ROUGH.

<p>We find out that Roger's wife isn't dead, although it's just a small line, I suppose we'll find out more about that later. </p>

#### CAROLYN 

> AND THEN THERE'S DAVID.
> 
> A KID LIKE THAT WOULD MAKE ANYONE'S NERVES POP.
> 
> BUT YOU'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HIM TOMORROW.

#### VICTORIA 

> WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME NOW?

#### CAROLYN 

> BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND UNCLE ROGER.
> 
> HE'S REALLY A VERY NICE GUY.

<p>Yes, yes, we know you think he's a nice guy. Does "nice guy" mean the same thing in the sixties that it means today? I'm guessing not. But yes, he's a nice guy. But you can't marry him, Carolyn, so get over it.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-07.jpg" />

<p>After doing her task to summon Vicki, Carolyn heads off to bed and we get more mysterious doors that seem to close on their own, startling poor Vicki. Really, she's had enough to deal with on this crazy first night at Collinwood.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-08.jpg" />

<p>E.S. struggles with the door in this scene and it's hard to know whether she's actually having trouble with the set-piece or it's supposed to be more ghosts. I'm inclined to think she's struggling with the door unintentionally, but it sort of goes along well with all the ghosties that are going around making sure the doors are closed or open, or whatever they want them to be.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-09.jpg" />

<p>They talk about Burke Devlin some more but all I can notice is that Vicki is wearing a different pair of shoes than she was earlier in the evening. I remember because I thought it curious that Carolyn wears heels with her nightgown, and noticed Vicki was wearing a much more sensible pair of shoes in the scene. But Carolyn seems to have rubbed off on her already and she's wearing something that really doesn't look very comfortable to me. But enough of my aside.</p>

#### ROGER 

> LET'S START WITH A NIGHTCAP.

#### VICTORIA 

> NO, THANK YOU.

#### ROGER 

> EH. 
> 
> WELL I COULD DO WITH A SPOT OF BRANDY.
> 
> NOTHING QUITE SO SATISFYING AS A FINE BRANDY. 
> 
> YOU SHOULD TRY SOME.

#### VICTORIA 

> I HAVE. 
> 
> IT BURNS.

<p>They continue to talk about Burke. Honestly I zoned out. We were present for this scene between Burke and Victoria so we know she's innocent, so the whole thing ends up being not very compelling.</p>

#### ROGER 

> HE KNEW THAT I WAS LIVING HERE NOW, DIDN'T HE?

<p>Roger, giving away tiny little bits of information. So you weren't living here some time ago, and then started to again.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-11.jpg" />

<p>Vicki has finally had enough and storms out of the drawing room. She says she wants to get some sleep because she might want to take that early train in the morning. (No Vicki, don't leave us here!)</p>

<p>So much for that Roger charm. All bite and no sugar. She rushes up to her room and we hope we've heard enough out of Roger for one night.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-12.jpg" />

<p>Vicki's finally getting some well-deserved sleep when she is awoken by the sound of a woman sobbing. And I mean, really sobbing. I like the sound effect here because it really sounds very real, not a tinny sort of schmaltzy cry you usually get. </p>

<p>She goes downstairs to check out the drawing room but the sound stops when she gets there and knocks on the door. There's no one inside. Mysterious. Very mysterious.</p>

<p>When she comes out of the drawing room, however, there is a sound of a very real person. We finally meet David Collins, who slowly descends the stairs.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-13.jpg" />

<p>Was he disturbed by the crying as well? Did he simply hear Vicki out of bed? Surely if it were just that, he would have been disturbed by the ruckus made by the elder members of his family as well. No, my best guess is that he also heard the crying.</p>

<p>Vicki tries to be nice to him, but she either said something wrong, or, more likely, he had it made up in his mind that he was not about to welcome this new governess with open arms.</p>

#### VICTORIA 

> A FINE THING, FRIGHTENING A FEW FRIEND.

#### DAVID 

> ...

#### VICTORIA 

> WHAT'S THE MATTER, DAVID? 
> 
> CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?

#### DAVID 

> I HATE YOU.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0004-14.jpg" />

<p>Honestly, I think they did David dirty in this scene. I was hoping, and still am hoping, his father and everyone else is wrong about him. It is so sad to see everyone talk so disparagingly about a family member, and especially one who is a child.</p>

<p>This episode kind of dragged for me, especially because it mostly pertained to a scene between Burke and Victoria that we as the audience were already privy to. So we already know Vicki's innocent and Roger is just beating a dead horse. I was also upset about how they introduced David, but I will be patient and see how it pans out.</p>

<p>★★☆☆</p>
