#### VICTORIA 

> THE TOP OF WIDOW'S HILL IS A STRANGE AND LONELY PLACE AND THE GREAT HULK OF COLLINWOOD SITS LIKE A SLEEPING MONSTER ON ITS CREST.
> 
> I KNOW I SHOULD LEAVE AND YET I CAN'T, NOT AS LONG AS I FEEL THE ANSWERS I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MIGHT BE HERE.
> 
> HERE IN THE DARKNESS AND THE DUST OF HIDDEN YEARS SURROUNDED BY THE GHOSTS OF THE PAST AND THE FEARS OF THE PRESENT, I'VE DECIDED TO SEARCH AND HOPE AND WAIT.

<p>Another new set! Vicki comes down to the basement looking for David. I like the rounded doorway here, very classic. Digging the cobwebs, the view through the old picture frame. It seems very symbolic that even a family this wealthy has a spooky, dirty basement.</p>

<p>But Vicki is not alone. Matthew Morgan, the sole household servant of Collinwood, follows her and gives off a very creepy air -- he just stands there looking at Vicki for some time before speaking. He apparently has no idea who Vicki is, so I guess no one told him about the new governess for David.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-02.jpg" />

<p>He accuses her of trying to hurt Mrs. Stoddard and starts to wrestle with her, all while holding what looks like a fireplace poker. I'd be afraid too.</p>

<p>Luckily, Elizabeth comes down to the basement and reveals that his name and vocation to Vicki. They discuss the locked storeroom and seem a bit suspicious about the whole thing. (Note to self: come back to that one later.)</p>

<p>Soon it's just Elizabeth in the basement and she goes to check the storeroom's lock, but she is interrupted by a noise.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-03.jpg" />

<p>We're all delighted to find that Victoria was right about David being down here. Elizabeth handles it very well, calm, cool, collected, and we're reassured about her being the matriarch of the house. </p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-04.jpg" />

#### ELIZABETH 

> DAVID, WHY WON'T YOU LOOK AT ME?
> 
> I THOUGHT YOU AND I WERE FRIENDS.
>
> WHY WERE YOU HIDING DOWN HERE?

#### DAVID 

> I WANTED TO.

#### ELIZABETH 

> BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO COME DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.

#### DAVID 

> YOU'RE GOING TO HIT ME, AREN'T YOU?

#### ELIZABETH 

> 'COURSE NOT.

#### DAVID 

> THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO.

#### ELIZABETH 

> NOT WHILE YOU LIVE IN THIS HOUSE, HE WON'T.

#### DAVID 

> HE'S YOUR BROTHER, THAT MAKES IT HIS HOUSE TOO, DOESN'T IT?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-05.jpg" />

<p>David discusses his ideas against Victoria, and Elizabeth, still not quite validating his paranoia, at least shows him some compassion. It's a very nice scene, and one that is well-needed because the whole house (minus Vicki) seems to be turned against him. No wonder he acts out.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-06.jpg" />

<p>Victoria and Matthew have a cute scene where they introduce themselves to each other, all while not quite looking at each other, as if acknowledging that the two of them are worlds apart, even if they occupy a similar space as non-Collins at Collinwood.</p>

#### MATTHEW 

> MORGAN. MATTHEW MORGAN.

#### VICTORIA 

> WINTERS. VICTORIA WINTERS.

<p>Vicki tries to open the lines of communication, saying she'd like the two of them to be friends. They start in with gossip about the family and it seems they have a common point to be shared. Victoria is pretty forward, despite only having been here for a night. She asks about Mr. Stoddard.</p>

#### MATTHEW 

> I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM BUT I DO KNOW THAT MRS. STODDARD IS A GREAT LADY AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

#### VICTORIA 

> I THINK SHE'S VERY NICE.

<p>Matthew reveals that there is a house on the property that was given to him by Elizabeth as well as the promise of a job for the rest of his days. We find out that Collinwood used to have a great deal more staff, but they were all fired about the time Elizabeth's husband left. It's really a wonder the place is in as good shape as it is.</p>

<p>In the basement, Elizabeth tries to bond with David. She gives him a book, <u>Rover Boys</u>. I had to look that one up. Seems to be a more irreverent Hardy Boys. She says "Adventure stories. They belonged to your father when he was your age." To which David emphatically responds, "I don't want it."</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-08.jpg" />

#### ELIZABETH 

> DAVID, YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU, YOU KNOW THAT.

#### DAVID 

> NO HE DOESN'T. 
> 
> HE HATES ME.

#### ELIZABETH 

> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

#### DAVID 

> HE TOLD ME.

<p>David continues to insist that he doesn't want Victoria here, saying he fears his mother won't return if she's here. Elizabeth counters, saying his mother is very ill. (Those widows must be whispering some awful things to him.) Elizabeth reveals that Victoria is an orphan, and was a lonely child, and would never want to keep David apart from his mother.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Vicki tries to keep her nose out of trouble for a moment, and glances through a book. Carolyn comes in, desperate to keep stirring drama.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-10.jpg" />

#### CAROLYN

> OH VICKI WHAT'S MY USE OF HAVING BRIGHT IDEAS IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM?

#### VICTORIA 

> OH, THE MONEY, YOU MEAN.

<p>Poor Vicki, she's being really very pushy about this. I don't envy Victoria in this moment. This isn't her mother she would be pestering, but her boss and the head of the household. Carolyn's a little tone-deaf here.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-11.jpg" />

<p>Elizabeth comes up and the phone rings. I'm delighted to see that they have some new technology here in this drafty mansion. It's Joe Haskell on the other end, and Carolyn takes the call in the hallway like a real sixties teenager.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-12.jpg" />

#### ELIZABETH 

> WELL NOW MISS WINTERS, I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT MANY THINGS TO DISCUSS.

<p>(Scary!)</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-13.jpg" />

<p>Carolyn lets us in on the fact that Joe has some kind of surprise for us. Oh my, I hope he didn't take the money from Burke Devlin. Please don't let him have taken the money, please!</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-14.jpg" />

<p>Elizabeth tries to discuss her concerns about David with Vicki, but she changes the topic and asks, "How much do you really know about me?"</p>

<p>Oh Vicki. This isn't the time or place. You're letting Carolyn get to you.</p>

<p>Vicki reminds us about her backstory and I can't help but think she should let this go for now and try to help David. That is the reason she was brought here in the first place. </p>

<p>Elizabeth insists that she knows nothing about Vicki's past except that she came highly recommended from Hammond Foundling Home and she quickly runs out. Oh boy, I hope she's telling the truth... </p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-15.jpg" />

<p>Raising the drama, Vicki tries to quickly place a call to her orphanage, but ends her call when Carolyn rushes into the drawing room. Carolyn just can't wait to see if Vicki got any dirt on her past but Victoria intends to take the next bus into town. O-okay... We don't know what she's got planned.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-07.jpg" />

<p>Carolyn, being very generous, offers Vicki her car instead (Baby you can drive my car--) and I can't help but wonder who taught these ladies to drive. Maybe Carolyn got lessons from her uncle, but who taught Vicki? Did she take lessons? What car did she have to use at the foundling home?</p>

<p>Vicki leaves the house and her mother comes into the entry, asking what all the noise was about. Carolyn delivers the last line of the episode, and it's a bit curious.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> JUST ONE OF OUR GHOSTS STARTING TO RATTLE AROUND A BIT.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0006-17.jpg" />

<p>Overall a solid episode, despite some dry bits. I liked the new set, but was a little upset to see Vicki caving so easily to peer pressure over her backstory. I realize I can't know how terrible it must be to not know where you come from, but it just seems a little unwise to make such a big point out of it to your new employer, especially when it's a stretch as it is. I was glad to see Elizabeth show some love toward David.</p>
