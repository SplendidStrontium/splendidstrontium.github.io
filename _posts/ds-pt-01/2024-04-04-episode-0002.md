#### VICTORIA 

> MY NAME IS VICTORIA WINTERS.
> 
> COLLINWOOD; THE GREAT HOUSE ON TOP OF WIDOW'S HILL IS A FRIGHTENING PLACE TO END A JOURNEY.
> 
> THE GHOSTS OF YESTERDAY SEEM TO TELL ME TO RUN BUT I'M HERE NOW AND THERE IS NO TURNING BACK.

<p>Episode 2 opens where it closed, in the grand entry room of Collinwood. We learn from Elizabeth that Collinwood has a total of forty rooms. When Victoria reacts in amazement, Elizabeth says that except for a man to do the heavy work, they do it all themselves. I guess they hadn't yet cast Mrs. Johnson! </p>

<p>We also learn that Jeremiah Collins is Elizabeth's great grandfather. He was a strong man. Conversation is a little terse between the two women but friendly enough. It seems perfectly natural, especially for a woman who hasn't left the estate in eighteen years.</p>

<p>Note to self, Vicki takes her tea with lemon and one lump of sugar.</p>

<p>And as she likes her tea, Vicki is sweet and asks about David. </p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> DAVID IS LIKELY TO BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER BOY YOU'VE EVER MET.

<p>But there's one other Collins heir we haven't talked about yet.</p>

<p>I love the introduction here. Elizabeth mentions her daughter and suddenly some spunky dance music starts playing and we're back at the Blue Whale, where the kids have come in to enjoy the jukebox. Yes, it seems the two are about as different as different can be.</p>

#### WILBER STRAKE

> IT SURE STARTS JUMPING WHEN THE KIDS GET HERE.

#### BURKE 

> YOU POSITIVE THAT'S CAROLYN STODDARD?

#### WILBER STRAKE 

> REAL FIRE-EATER, EH?

<p>This here joker apparently isn't satisfied with the jukebox and wanders over to bug Carolyn for a dance. But Joe's not about to be made a fool of.</p>

<p>Carolyn left Joe Haskell for some rando, what a tart!</p>

<p>Burke claims he's a friend of the family. Bold words! He then proceeds to tell Carolyn that she had better head home "before I take you over my knee and paddle you right in the middle of the dance floor." Wow! The things you could say in the sixties!!</p>

<p>Vicki asks Elizabeth and she seems to tell a lie, that she got a recommendation from someone Roger knew or some such. But they are interrupted in the middle of their conversation by Carolyn arriving home.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> BIG SHOT.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0002-08.jpg" max-width="1000" />

<p>This scene with Elizabeth and Carolyn is very nice. Elizabeth comes off as a doting mother.</p>

#### ELIZABETH

> I THOUGHT YOU LIKED JOE HASKELL.

#### CAROLYN 

> I LOVE HIM BUT HE'S NOT A WHITE KNIGHT.

#### ELIZABETH 

> WE CAN'T GET EVERYTHING WE WANT, DEAR.

#### CAROLYN 

> WELL I'M GOING TO TRY.

<p>Vicki goes out to look at the ocean. Roger, with oodles of charm:</p>

#### ROGER 

> NOT PLANNING TO JUMP, ARE YOU?
> 
> YOU WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST, YOU KNOW.

<p>She quickly changes the subject, but Roger is reticent to talk about his son.</p>

#### ROGER 

> I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN WHAT HE DOES LIKE.

<p>The episode ends with the surprise relevation that Elizabeth plays piano, and Vicki spies on her for a few moments before Elizabeth puts her head down in what is presumably exhaustion.</p>

<p>Overall a very solid episode. We were introduced to some new characters and we even got to see the edge of Widow's Hill, a location that will come back to, er, haunt us, as we progress further in the show. I enjoyed the barfight and the motherly side of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>★★★☆</p>
