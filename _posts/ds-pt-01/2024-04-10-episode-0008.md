<p>Episode 8 opens with Elizabeth stepping into Vicki's room to close a window. I suppose she feels she has an extra level of stewardship over this room as it was the room she spent her childhood in.</p>

<p>She sifts through Vicki's letters and reads one of them. I must say E.S. is a conflicted character for me. I've been happy about the affection she has shown toward David, one of his few allies in this kooky house, but she shouldn't be reading someone else's mail!</p>

<p>Carolyn bursts in and starts in on the 'Why Vicki' card. </p>

#### CAROLYN 

> BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE WENT INTO TOWN. 
> 
> SHE INTENDED TO CALL THE FOUNDLING HOME TO SEE IF YOU WERE TELLING THE TRUTH.

<p>Looks like she's a bit worried. Really, Elizabeth. The good part about telling the truth is that you can't get caught in a lie. I'm looking forward to see how this one turns out.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-03.jpg" />

<p>Back at the Collinsport Inn, Vicki has finally reached Miss Hopewell. What a name for the head of an orphanage. Very cute.</p>

<p>They discuss the truth and E.S. is found out to be, presumably, caught in a lie. No one had ever heard of the Collins family, definitely not a recommendation from a friend of Roger's.</p>

<p>Carolyn and E.S. prepare for the visit from Joe. Elizabeth is, presumably, sour about the prospect of being caught in her fib, and stares forlorn out the window. Elizabeth raises the idea of sending Vicki away, and Carolyn resists.</p>

<p>Elizabeth says she invited Vicki to help encourage Carolyn to leave the house and marry Joe Haskell.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-05.jpg" />

<p>Joe is a sweet guy and brought flowers for Elizabeth and Carolyn. Elizabeth steals off to the kitchen to put her flowers in water.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-06.jpg" />

<p>"Boo!" he exclaims. "Still like little yellow roses?" And then the punchline, "Compliments of Joe Haskell, ex-fisherman."</p>

<p>Okay, good, so hopefully the surprise is NOT that he took the money from Burke Devlin. Because with a name like Devlin, you should definitely not accept his bribes... Not in the town of Collinsport, that's for sure.</p>

<p>He goes in for a kiss and she turns her head... Hmm. Something tells me that she's not into him like he is for her.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-07.jpg" />

<p>He reveals that he got a promotion to a checker, and will be making an additional $25/week. Very nice Joe! Carolyn says she's very happy for him and they share a tender moment. He says he'll be able to save another $500/year and will soon be able to afford his boat. Very nice, you go Joe.</p>

<p>Except... He proposes marriage and she rebuffs him. Oh dear. Poor Joe. Then he's got to sit and have tea with Carolyn's mother.</p>

<p>I guess she wouldn't be able to take dances with other guys at the Blue Whale.</p>

<p>Carolyn figures it out -- Elizabeth suggested to Bill Malloy that he promote Joe. And there goes the happy air of the day.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-08.jpg" />

<p>Vicki arrives back at Collinwood and she returns the keys to Carolyn. They chat in the hallway and Carolyn expresses her displeasure. </p>

#### CAROLYN 

> IT'S ME, VICKI.
> 
> I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AWAY AND I'M SCARED.
> 
> I'M JUST PLAIN SCARED.

<p>Inside the drawing room, Joe shows himself to be an upstanding guy and tells E.S. about meeting with Burke. He tells her that he offered to pay him for information about the Collins family and Vicki. But he refused to give any information.</p>

#### JOE 

> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

#### CAROLYN 

> I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> ALL I KNOW IS THAT EVERY TIME I LIKE SOMEONE OR NEED SOMEONE, I SEEM TO DO MY BEST TO PUSH THEM AWAY.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-11.jpg" />

<p>Upstairs, Vicki and E.S. combat each other about the recommendation story. </p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> BUT I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO QUESTION AND PROBE EVERYTHING I SAY!

<p>E.S. is clearly caught in a hard place here. I must say that I don't think she's telling the truth, but what can be done about it, I don't know.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-12.jpg" />

<p>We flash back to the orphanage, where Miss Hopewell is dictating a letter in which she describes a troublesome situation in which she was interrogated by Burke's private investigator. She says he was "anxious to learn why you had been hired by the Collins family". </p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0008-13.jpg" />

<p>A solid episode but it just seemed to lack a certain sort of oompf for me to really enjoy it. I was saddened to learn that Joe's promotion was encouraged by E.S. and bummed to see that Carolyn's just not that into him. But I think Carolyn has some high expectations for a white knight to come sweep her off her feet. We'll see if that ever happens.</p>

<p>★★☆☆</p>
