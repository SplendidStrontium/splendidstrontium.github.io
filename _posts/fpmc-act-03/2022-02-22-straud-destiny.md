#### OPHELIA

> LIKE, ISN'T VLAD LATE WITH OUR STUFF?

#### ESTHER

> HE IS A LITTLE LATE. HE'S BEEN LATE A LOT LATELY.

#### OPHELIA

> HE DOESN'T, LIKE, HAVE HIS ASSISTANT ANYMORE.

#### ESTHER

> MANDARC?

#### OPHELIA

> YEAH. MANDARC MOVED OUT.

#### ESTHER

> THAT'S A BUMMER I GUESS.

#### OPHELIA

> JUST MEANS HE'S GOT LESS HELP AROUND THE HOUSE.

#### ESTHER

> I'M SURPRISED HE KEPT ANYONE AROUND.

#### OPHELIA

> HE'S ALWAYS HAD PEOPLE AROUND.

#### ESTHER

> SO MUCH FOR LONER TRAIT.

#### OPHELIA

> PSH-YEAH!

#### ESTHER

> REMEMBER THAT ONE PARTY?

#### OPHELIA

> YOU KNOW I DO.

#### ESTHER

> SHOULD I CALL HIM?

#### OPHELIA

> NAW.
> 
> HE'LL BE HERE.

*****
<BR><I>The girls cycle about the apartment. Ophelia was going through a phase wherein she didn't care to be around Esther unless she were in an exceedingly good mood. It was recent and unusual and seemed centered on her sister. Who is to say if she'd grow out of it?</i>

<i>I was lurking about in the shadows outside their entrance waiting for an appropriate time to interrupt.</i>

<i>I knock on the door.</i>

#### STRAUD

> GIRLS.

#### ESTHER & OPHELIA

> VLAD!!

#### ESTHER

> IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

#### OPHELIA

> PLEASE COME IN.

<BR><I>The girls let me into their flat.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE.

<BR><I>Ophelia waves her hand to dismiss my concern. It was a showy gesture, bold and unbidden, as was her mannerism.</i>

#### OPHELIA

> IT'S NO BIGGIE.

#### ESTHER

> YEAH, SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE HELP ANYMORE WE JUST FIGURED YOU'RE A BIT SHORT-HANDED.

#### OPHELIA

> WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.

<br><i>Esther loved to correct her sister.</i>

#### ESTHER

> WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

#### OPHELIA

> WE'RE TAKING SOME CLASSES.

#### STRAUD

> THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS, GIRLS.

<BR><I>I take a moment to brush my hands off on my wool coat, straightening it out from the voyage.</i>

#### STRAUD

> AS FOR THE ASSERTION THAT I DON'T HAVE HELP ANYMORE, I MUST INSIST THAT'S NOT TRUE.
> 
> I HAVE MORE HELP THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.
> 
> I POSSESS NO IMPEDIMENTS TO VISITING YOU TWO ONCE A WEEK. IN FACT, I RATHER LOOK FORWARD TO THE EXCHANGE. IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST GOSSIP.
> 
> ALTHOUGH ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION, I WOULD LIKE TO BORE YOU A MOMENT OR TWO WITH A FAIRYTALE.

<BR><I>Esther, too, maintains the appearance of her dress, flattening her hands against her hip.</i>

#### ESTHER

> OH, YOUR STORIES ARE NEVER BORING, VLAD.

#### OPHELIA

> IT'S BEEN FOREVER SINCE YOU TOLD US A STORY.

<BR><I>I brush down my hair and think for a moment on my top hat.</i>

<i>If the era were different, I might be removing it right now and placing it upon a hook.</i>

#### STRAUD

> SINCE YOUR MOTHER PASSED.

<BR><I>My statement brings a somber tone into the gathering.</i>

#### ESTHER & OPHELIA

> YEAH.

<BR><I>I wonder how genuine their emotions are. The girls were often a torrent of tumultuous reactions.</i>

#### STRAUD

> HOW HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

#### ESTHER

> WE'VE BEEN ALRIGHT.

#### OPHELIA

> BEEN A LITTLE, YA KNOW, QUIET AROUND HERE.

#### STRAUD

> I'M SURE IT HAS BEEN. 
> 
> THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON I THOUGHT I MIGHT LINGER ON YOUR PRESENCE FOR A MOMENT MORE THAN IS OUR CUSTOMARY.

#### ESTHER

> OH, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
> 
> IT'S JUST NICE OF YOU TO BRING THE GOODS HERE, WEEK AFTER WEEK.

#### OPHELIA

> YEAH, IT'S REAL NICE.

<BR><I>But the girls don't realize that I see the delivery as my duty, in the memory of their mother, to continue on as I had been doing. It is fine for them to express gratitude, but I would continue at my task with or without their display.</i>

<i>We leave the foyer and make our way to the sitting room. The television is on. It's a fairly recent addition to the flat. Or at least, it feels recent to me.</i>

<i>The windows are generous and lightly frosted.</i>

<i>I start into my speech.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THERE ONCE WAS A PRINCESS OF A KINGDOM FAR AWAY.
> 
> YOU GIRLS STILL BELIEVE IN PRINCESSES, DON'T YOU GIRLS?

#### ESTHER & OPHELIA

> OF COURSE WE DO!

#### STRAUD

> THIS PRINCESS LIVED FAR AWAY BUT WAS MUCH LIKE US IN VALUES AND SENSIBILITY.
> 
> HER MOTHER WAS BENEFICIENT, NEVER PAUSING TO GIVE GIFT UPON ANY WHO NEEDED IT.
> 
> BUT THE PRINCESS GREW UP SPOILED AND IGNORANT OF THE VALUE OF THE SPLENDOR SHE TOOK AS SO COMMONPLACE.
> 
> IT WAS NO ONE'S FAULT AS MUCH AS IT WAS EVERYONE'S FAULT.
> 
> HER MOTHER AND FATHER ALWAYS HAD SOME MANNER OF BUSINESS THAT THEY HAD TO TEND TO.
> 
> THIS, TOO, WAS THE FAULT OF EVERYONE AND YET, NO ONE.
> 
> IT WAS A TIME OF GREAT CONFLICT AND THE TWO PARENTS WERE EMBROILED IN THE AFFAIRS OF RULING A KINGDOM.
> 
> SURELY YOU TWO MIGHT UNDERSTAND; YOUR PARENTS ALWAYS SENDING YOU OFF TO SCHOOL?

#### ESTHER

> WELL, MOM FELT WE NEEDED TO LEARN SOMETHING.

#### STRAUD

> THAT'S VERY WISE OF YOU TO SAY, ESTHER.
> 
> SHE DID FEEL HER DAUGHTERS SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN WHAT WAS OFFERED TO HER.
> 
> I DARESAY NEITHER OF YOU HAVE SUFFERED DUE TO YOUR SCHOOLING.

#### OPHELIA

> NO, IT WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME.

#### STRAUD

> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.
> 
> TIME ENJOYED IS NEVER WASTED.

#### ESTHER

> YOU'RE SUCH AN OPTIMIST.

#### STRAUD

> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SUCH ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. 

#### OPHELIA

> ANYWAY, PLEASE CONTINUE.

#### STRAUD

> WARTIME BRINGS IN ITS WAKE BOTH GREAT TURMOIL BUT ALSO SOIL RICH WITH THE BLOOD OF ONE'S ENEMIES.
> 
> THAT SOIL IS RICH FOR GROWING FRUIT.
> 
> SO LONG AS IT IS NOT TAINTED WITH ASH.

#### ESTHER

> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRL'S MOTHER?

#### STRAUD

> THE PRINCESS? HER MOTHER, THE QUEEN, DIED.
> 
> WHETHER DUE TO OLD AGE OR A BROKEN HEART, NONE CAN BE SURE. 
> 
> BUT THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT HER, NO, HER DEATH OCCURRED LONG AGO.
> 
> THE PRINCESS WAS WISE TO THE WAYS OF THE WORLD.
> 
> TO PURSUE HER DESTINY, SHE KNEW SHE HAD TO GO ON A GREAT JOURNEY, ONE THAT COULD EQUALLY RESULT IN HER DEATH.
> 
> BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER IN THE OLD WORLD.
> 
> ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE KNEW SHE COULD NOT SURVIVE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCE.
> 
> SHE PRAYED AND PRAYED AND THE GODS SENT HER AN IMMORTAL STEED, THE MOUNT PEGASUS.

#### OPHELIA

> REMINDS ME OF SAILOR MOON.

#### STRAUD

> THERE ARE CERTAIN SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THAT TALE AND OURS. 
> 
> BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER THE DIFFERENCES AS WELL.
> 
> HERS WAS A TIME OF GREAT WAR.
> 
> BUT WAR MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE TRUE CHILDREN.
> 
> NO, THIS PRINCESS WAS AN ADOLESCENT COMPLETE WITH THE LIMITATIONS AND RIGHTS CONFERRED UPON THAT LIFE STAGE.
> 
> SHE HAD NO SHORTAGE OF KNIGHTS KNOCKING DOWN HER DOORSTOP, AN ACT THAT WENT MOSTLY UNWATCHED BY HER ELDERS.
> 
> BUT THEY WERE A CHIVALRIC LOT, AS THE SOLDIERS OF THE TIME WERE. IT FALLS IN AND OUT OF FASHION, THAT SET OF RULES.
> 
> SHE NEVER TOOK ANYONE'S HAND, KNOWING HER DUTY FELL TO HER KINGDOM.
> 
> SHE KNEW SHE NEEDED TO FOLLOW IN HER PARENTS' FOOTSTEPS.
> 
> THE PRINCESS KNEW SHE NEEDED TO MAKE A JOURNEY IN ORDER TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF HELPING HER NATION.
> 
> IT COLORED HER WAKING MOMENTS UNTIL SHE COULD TAKE IT NO LONGER AND SHE LEFT THE PLACE OF HER BIRTH.

#### ESTHER

> WAS IT THAT SHE FEARED DEATH?

#### STRAUD

> EITHER HERS OR THE VERY RUIN OF HER PEOPLE.
> 
> BUT SHE MADE HER JOURNEY, AND LIVED TO TELL THE TALE.
> 
> BUT WHAT SHE FOUND FRIGHTENED HER TO HER VERY CORE, AND SHE KNEW NOT HOW TO RECTIFY THE ISSUE.

#### OPHELIA

> WHAT DID SHE FIND?

#### STRAUD

> A GODLESS WORLD.
> 
> A WORLD WHERE THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH WERE ATTEMPTING TO RULE THEMSELVES, IGNORANT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE BY WHICH THEY'D BEEN PLACED UPON IT.
> 
> SHE HAD DESIRED TO FOLLOW IN HER PARENTS' FOOTSTEPS BUT HER MOTHER AND FATHER WERE UNKNOWNS IN THIS NEW PLACE.

#### ESTHER

> BUT SHE STILL HAD HER PEGASUS.

<BR><I>I bow to her slightly, trying to impress upon her my gratitude for her paying attention to my tale.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOU'RE VERY CORRECT, ESTHER.
> 
> SHE STILL POSSESSED THE GUIDANCE OF THE PEGASUS.
> 
> THERE WAS STILL THE REMNANTS OF AN OLD RELIGION WHICH HAD SUNG THE PRAISES OF THE MONARCHY AND ITS DEIFIC SPONSORSHIP.
> 
> BUT THE MESSAGE WAS OBSCURED BEHIND FALSE PROPHECY AND MISTAKEN RHETORIC.
> 
> DARE I REMIND YOU THAT OUR PRINCESS IS TROUBLED WITH THE ALL-CONSUMING WORSHIP OF THE NEW, AS IS COMMON IN PLACES RAVAGED BY WAR. SHE DOES NOT WANT TO LINGER UPON THE MESSAGE OF THE YOUNG CHURCH AND TRY TO WAIT FOR WORDS TO FALL OUT OF FASHION. 
> 
> SHE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VISIONS AND REFUSES TO DELIVER A PATIENCE UPON THE FEW WORSHIPPERS THAT REMAIN.
> 
> THE PRINCESS TAKES OVER THE CHURCH AND INSISTS HER PEOPLE, AN ANCIENT SORT OF ELF, WILL BE BACK TO CAST JUDGMENT OVER THE PLANET IN THE LIGHT OF THE GODS THAT HAD MADE THEIR HOME THERE.
> 
> SHE PROCLAIMED THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO TRULY BELIEVE.
> 
> BUT SHE MADE UNFOUNDED PROMISES, FOR SHE'D BEEN UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH THE GODS OF THE NEW LAND.
> 
> HER CHURCH A COLLECTION OF ILL-LED BISHOPS.

#### OPHELIA

> DID SHE KNOW WHAT SHE DID?

#### STRAUD

> THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION, OPHELIA.
> 
> NO, I DO NOT THINK SHE WAS AWARE OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE POWERS OF THE GODS HAD CHANGED.
> 
> FOR HER WORLD WAS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OURS IS.
> 
> SHE ASSUMED THE NEW LAND WAS LIKE THE OLD LAND. BUT IT WAS THERE SHE WAS MISTAKEN.

#### OPHELIA

> IF THAT'S THE WAY SHE WAS RAISED, IT'S LESS HER FAULT.

#### ESTHER

> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. SHE TRIED HER BEST TO DO GOOD BY HER PARENTS.

<BR><I>I suppose I should not expect my tale about the irreverence of youth to fall uncontested upon their ears.</i>

#### OPHELIA

> HOW WAS SHE TO KNOW THAT THE NEW WORLD HAD MORE GODS IN IT?

#### ESTHER

> THE GODS ARE NOT KNOWN FOR GIFTING US THEIR HOW-TO MANUALS.

#### STRAUD

> IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS USED TO APPROACHING THE WORLD AS A SET OF DISPARATE POINTS WAITING TO BE AMALGAMATED. ORGANIZED. CONQUERED.
> 
> ONE OF HER DEFINING FAULTS WAS THAT SHE DID NOT LISTEN TO HER WOULD-BE CONSTITUENTS. SHE SAW EVERYTHING IN THE SHADOW OF WHAT SHE'D KNOWN IN HER CHILDHOOD.
> 
> WARTIME DOES NOT OFTEN TEACH THE MERITS OF ABSORBING THE SPEECH OF ONE'S RIVALS.

#### ESTHER

> WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

#### STRAUD

> WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? WHY, SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE CHURCH THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAID IN HER HANDS AS A GIFT AMONG GIFTS. 
> 
> BY REFUSING TO INTERFACE WITH ITS ROOTS, SHE DAMNED THE CHURCH.
> 
> SHE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WORTH FINDING, IF SHE'D LOOKED MORE CAREFULLY.

#### OPHELIA

> SO YOU'RE SAYING SHE TRAVELED ALL THIS WAY JUST SO SHE COULD FAIL AT TAKING OVER THE NEW NATION?

#### STRAUD

> NOW BE CAREFUL WITH MY WORDS, GIRLS.
> 
> I DID NOT SAY THAT SHE FAILED IN TAKING OVER THE NEW NATION.
> 
> JUST THAT SHE DID SO GODLESSLY.

#### ESTHER

> BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT AS A FAILURE BECAUSE OTHERWISE SHE'LL GET CURSED OR SOMETHING.

#### STRAUD

> ASTUTE.
> 
> BEWARE THE PRETENSES UNDER WHICH YOU ARE BORN. TRY TO COME AT LIFE WITH AN UNBIASED PERSPECTIVE.
> 
> AND, AS ALWAYS, BEWARE THE WRATH OF THE GODS.

#### OPHELIA

> FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, I DIG IT.

<BR><I>She roughhouses an elbow into my side, unwelcome.</i>

#### ESTHER

> THAT ONE WASN'T SO BAD, VLAD.
> 
> I LIKE ONES WITH PRINCESSES.

<BR><I>I mutter quietly to myself, irritated that the girls have aleady fled into one of their other distractions.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT WAS A...CAUTIONARY TALE.

<BR>
