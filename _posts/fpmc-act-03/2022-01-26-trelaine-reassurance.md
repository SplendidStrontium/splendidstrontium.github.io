### // THE CONVERTED TRAIN STATION //

<br><i>In a bed in Brooklyn stirs the woman Avaelle Easton. Sitting on the edge of her bed is an older gentleman.</i>

#### McCOY

> IT HAS COME TIME TO PLACE YOU INTO YOUR SUIT, LITTLE ONE.

<BR><I>Avaelle pulls the blankets back over her head.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> I'M NOT READY TODAY.
> 
> I'M THE ONE THAT HAS TO DO IT.

#### McCOY

> THE SOONER YOU GET IN, THE SOONER YOU'LL GET TO PRACTICE, THE SOONER IT GETS EASIER.

#### AVAELLE

> I KNEW YOU'D COME AFTER ME WITH THAT INCESSANT OPTIMISM.

#### McCOY

> IS IT NOT UNTRUE?

#### AVAELLE

> IT'S TRUE, JUST...IT'S A BIG THING.
> 
> I'M DIZZY, I'M AFRAID.

#### McCOY

> JUST THINK OF IT AVAELLE, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO MAGIC.
> 
> REAL MAGIC.

#### AVAELLE

> WHILE BEING TRAPPED IN A GIANT ROBOT SUIT.

#### McCOY

> YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF WHEN YOU SLEEP.
> 
> THAT'LL BE THE GOOD TIMES AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU MIGHT GET SO USED TO IT YOU'LL JUST SLUMBER AWAY RIGHT INSIDE THE SAFETY OF ITS HOUSING.

#### AVAELLE

> WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

#### McCOY

> IT'S THE PRODUCT OF--

#### AVAELLE

> YEARS, DECADES, OF RESEARCH.
> 
> YES, I KNOW.
> 
> I'LL COME AROUND...JUST, WHY TODAY?
> 
> IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS, YOU KNOW, FOR REAL.

#### McCOY

> IT WAS, IN THE GRAND SCHEME.

#### AVAELLE

> I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW OR WHY IT WORKS.

#### McCOY 

> WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE?

#### AVAELLE

> I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, REALLY.
> 
> IF YOU SAY THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

<BR><I>In the hallway, slinking about in a long dress, is Vanessa Tang. She enters the bedroom, leaning against the doorjamb.</i>

<i>She seems in a foul, dangerously bored mood. The kind of mood that would have housecats toying with the village mice.</i>

#### VANESSA

> AW, COME NOW, SIS, IT COULDN'T BE ALL THAT BAD.
> 
> YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT EVERY NIGHT AND SLEEP IN YOUR LUSH BEDSHEETS.
> 
> MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF.

<BR><I>Avaelle shoots a poisonous barb of an expression at the intruder.</i>
