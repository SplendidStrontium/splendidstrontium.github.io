### // THE CONVERTED TRAIN STATION //

<BR><I>It's been a quiet fall. Just two months ago, my beloved [returned]({% post_url /fpmc-act-03/2021-10-14-trelaine-pinch %}) to me. I was thankful, I was grateful; leaving the young vampress VANESSA TANG alone was not only trying my patience, it was downright unsafe. Giving her the Curse of my ancestors was something I privately regretted but had tried to spend little time dwelling over.</i>

<i>In all of my time as a Vampire, I could not recall a convert who had reacted in such a way. The girl was unhinged, manic. She laughed when she inflicted suffering on others. Her eyes steely and unmoving while others quivered in pain. I suspect she's always been this way but the Curse has given her a new freedom.</i>

<i>I'm trying to contain her, trying to give her an outlet for her unbridled aggression. I must try to funnel her into something productive. But what?</i>

<i>The Sun beats down overhead, the smallest trickles of which crowd the edges of the windows. I have the day off from my duties at the Clinic and am spending the day with AVAELLE.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> SHE'S BEEN READING EVERY LORE BOOK SHE CAN GET HER HANDS ON.
> 
> IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HER. SHE'S GETTING A LOT OF FAULTY IDEAS IN HER HEAD.
> 
> YOU NEED TO START EDUCATING HER.

#### TRELAINE

> I KNOW I DO.

<BR><I>I had my suspicions about where she'd learnt to drain the bodies completely dry.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> THERE'S LITTLE I CAN DO FOR HER ANYMORE.
> 
> SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME, DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO ME.

#### TRELAINE 

> DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
> 
> SHE'S NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND.

#### AVAELLE

> I ACCEPT THAT BUT SHE DOESN'T ACCEPT ME.

#### TRELAINE

> PERHAPS WE SHOULD ACCELERATE THE PLAN.

#### AVAELLE

> I DON'T THINK I'M READY.
> 
> IF YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED THE DESIGN, I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M READY.
> 
> I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER BE READY.

#### TRELAINE

> I KNOW IT'S FRIGHTENING, BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANY WHO'D BE MORE WELL-SUITED.

#### AVAELLE

> HOW APROPROS.
> 
> I DON'T KNOW. I'LL TRY.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'LL SUCCEED. IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

#### AVAELLE

> YEAH, AND I'VE ALWAYS HATED THAT ASSERTION.
> 
> WHAT USE TO ME ARE THINGS MY ANCESTORS DID?
> 
> COULDN'T I JUST WEAR THE GLOVES?

#### TRELAINE

> WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE TO SEE THE FEEDBACK IN YOUR NERVES.
> 
> YOU WOULD NEED TO WEAR THE ENTIRE OUTFIT.

#### AVAELLE

> SO MUCH FOR GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE.

#### TRELAINE

> WHERE WE'RE GOING, YOU WON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT SUCH TRIVIALITIES.

#### AVAELLE

> MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
> 
> I'LL THINK ON IT, OKAY?
> 
> ANYWAY.
> 
> VANESSA WANTED TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING. 

#### TRELAINE

> I'LL GO WAIT ON HER.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>VANESSA had claimed an underground room as her bedroom. She'd fastened a sturdy lock on the inside of the door but today it had been left undone. I come in and sit on the empty bed.</i>

<i>The youngest vampires had the greatest need to regenerate during the day, their wills not honed enough yet to resist the siren's call of peace and quiet. The meditation promised a temporary still from the Craving, a still the younglings desperately needed.</i>

<i>I wring my hands and wait. I look about her windowless room. She'd decorated it in children's fare, collecting posters and figurines of characters I didn't recognize. Many of them possessed hair and eyes in colors not naturally occurring in Earth's humans. </i>

<i>It was a funny thing for which to strive.</i>

<i>I can feel her stirring in her wooden coffin, the stale essence of life crackling like firewood.</i>

<i>Soon, she pushes the lid off and emerges, easily rising to her feet.</i>

<i>She wears a long dress in dark blue lace. Even before she turns around to make eye contact with me, she knows I am here and her expression warms into a smile.</i>

<i>She turns around to greet me.</i>

#### VANESSA

> LENARD. GOOD MORNING.

#### TRELAINE

> 'EVENING', VANESSA. 
> 
> NO LONGER DO YOU WAKE IN THE MORNING.
> 
> YOUR ROUTINE HAS CHANGED, BUT THE TIMEKEEPER'S HAS NOT.

<br><i>She sits in a revolving desk chair.</i>

#### VANESSA

> I KNOW, I KNOW--
> 
> BUT WHAT GOOD IS FITTING IN WHEN I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS?
> 
> DO I NEED TO IMPRESS ALVARO WITH MY FINE BREEDING AND CULTURE?

<br><i>ALVARO HALCOM was another of our coven with whom VANESSA did not get along well.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> TRADITION, VANESSA.
> 
> IT'S ABOUT TRADITION.

#### VANESSA

> AND FAMILY VALUES?

<BR><I>She pauses and turns about in the swiveling chair with a twisted grin on her face.</i>

#### VANESSA

> FAMILY VALUES... YES, FAMILY VALUES!
> 
> THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
> 
> I DON'T WANT MY MOTHER AROUND ANYMORE.

#### TRELAINE

> VANESSA...

<BR><I>AVAELLE had been right. I needed to educate the girl. But how could I tell her the truth when I didn't yet trust her to keep it?</i>

#### TRELAINE 

> VANESSA, I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

#### VANESSA

> AND WHY THE HELL NOT?!
> 
> YOU DON'T LET ME HAVE ANYTHING I WANT!

#### TRELAINE

> THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU <U>CAN</U> HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT.
> 
> YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT ON IT.

#### VANESSA

> I'M TIRED OF WAITING!
> 
> I'VE BEEN WAITING ON HER FOR YEARS!

<BR><I>The impatience of youth infuriates me, but I try to contain my rage.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> SHE'S AN OLD WOMAN.
> 
> SHE WON'T LIVE FOREVER.

#### VANESSA

> BUT SHE COULD! DON'T YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THE POTION WORKS?
> 
> SHE'LL BE DEATHLESS AND AGELESS AND IMMUNE TO THE COMMON COLD!

#### TRELAINE

> (stern) I DO HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW IT WORKS.

#### VANESSA 

> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ENJOY LIFE ETERNAL WHEN SHE'S STILL AROUND POLLUTING MY VIEW?

#### TRELAINE

> WE'RE NOT HERE TO ENJOY IT.

#### VANESSA

> BULLSHIT!
> 
> I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF IRON MAIDEN <U>YOU</U> SLEEP IN, I INTEND TO ENJOY THIS 'CURSE' OF YOURS!

#### TRELAINE

> IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE ENJOYED.

#### VANESSA

> THEN YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!

<BR><I>Silence fills the air. It is hard for me even to contemplate a proper education for the girl when she spends each night screaming in my face.</i>

#### VANESSA

> ANYWAY. 
> 
> I'LL OFFER YOU A DEAL.
> 
> YOU GET ME MY MOTHER AND I'LL STOP DRAINING THE BODIES DRY.
> 
> YOU SAY YOU WANT THEM LEFT ALIVE, FINE, YOU GOT IT: HALF-DRUNK, HALF-DEAD HUMANS COMIN' RIGHT UP.
> 
> BUT I WANT DEAR OLD MAMA GONE.

#### TRELAINE

> AND THEN TOMORROW YOU'LL BE BACK ASKING FOR YOUR BROTHER'S HEAD.

<BR><I>She scoffs.</i>

#### VANESSA

> PEH. 
> 
> NO I WON'T.
> 
> HE'S JUST A CHILD IN A MAN'S GAME.
> 
> A FOOL. I GOT A BETTER BUZZ FROM STREET DRUGS THAN I DID FROM HIS CONCOCTIONS.
> 
> MEN ARE USELESS.

<BR><I>I raise my eyebrow.</i>

#### VANESSA

> EXCEPT YOU, OF COURSE.
> 
> I HAVE NOTHING BUT THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HE WHO RAISED ME FROM THE DEAD.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

#### VANESSA

> OF COURSE I'M NOT. I'M BEING FRUITY.
> 
> BY DEAD I MEAN THE MORTALS AND HOW THEY, YOU KNOW, LIVE THEIR LIVES WITHOUT PURPOSE.
> 
> HOW THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD.

#### TRELAINE

> WORDS HAVE MEANING, VANESSA.

#### VANESSA

> OF COURSE THEY DO. BUT WHO SAYS I CAN'T CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE?
> 
> BUT LET'S NOT GET DISTRACTED.
> 
> I DO WANT MY MOTHER'S HEAD ON A PLATTER.
> 
> BUT I WANT TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT.

#### TRELAINE

> WHY? ISN'T DEATH BY OLD AGE A CRUELER FATE?
> 
> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HER WEEP OVER YOUR ABANDONED TEDDY BEARS?
> 
> SHE STILL MAINTAINS HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE FOUND AND RETURNED.

#### VANESSA

> I DON'T WANT HER TO DEVELOP HER IMMORTALITY!
> 
> I WON'T HAVE HER STAND NEXT TO ME IN THE END DAYS!

#### TRELAINE

> I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE LITTLE FEAR OF THAT.
> 
> SHE'S BEEN DROWNING IN HER TEARS.
> 
> SHE BLAMES HERSELF.

#### VANESSA

> AS WELL SHE SHOULD!
> 
> IT'S ABOUT TIME SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING!

#### TRELAINE

> IF A WITCH WILL NOT WORK, HER CAULDRON WILL COLLECT NAUGHT BUT DUST.
> 
> YOU SHOULD REJOICE OVER HER IDLE HANDS.

#### VANESSA

> ANYWAY, I CAN IMAGINE SHE STILL MOURNS MY DEPARTURE.
> 
> WATCHING HER WAILING IS NOT WHAT I'M AFTER.
> 
> IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW SHE'S SUFFERING--
> 
> WHICH, BY THE WAY, I'M WELL-AWARE FOOTAGE COULD BE FAKED--
> 
> I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING HER SUFFERING IS OVER.
> 
> AND BY CONSEQUENCE, MY OWN.

#### TRELAINE

> VANESSA.
> 
> GIVING YOURSELF WHAT YOU WANT OFTEN ONLY MAKES YOU WANT MORE.
> 
> YOU WANT THE WANTING. YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO LUST AFTER.

#### VANESSA

> I'LL GET OVER IT.
