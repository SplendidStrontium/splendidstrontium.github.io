<br>FROM: ROXANNE SCHWARTZ (personal)

TO: IVETTE CAMPBELL (personal)

Dear Ivette --

It was lovely to hear from you. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to write you back -- It's not your fault but I don't check that email address much any more. I've cc-ed the email address that I use more often these days. 

I am so glad to hear that you got a new position! I suppose you are looking for your 'forever home'. Will this be it? I'm glad you're back in the city. It would be a quiet place without you. 

I have taken a part-time job as an assistant to an estate. I help an older man manage his day-to-day affairs. It keeps me busy but leaves me time to work on my blog, as you saw. I'm writing a novel as well. 

How is Latoya? Is she still playing violin? I hope she's been enjoying some success. I know it's a cutthroat business, hers. 

I have a dog now. His name is Edward. He takes good care of me. He's a mutt. Do you have any pets? 

Write when you can. All my love,

ROXANNE
