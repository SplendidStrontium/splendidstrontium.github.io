<br><i>KEVIN keeps his car parked at the MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC and takes the train into the city. It was easier and safer than trying to find parking in Manhattan. Unlike outside of the city limits, not being chained to a car meant freedom.</i>

<i>It's no mystery why he wants to meet on the UWS. ANGELA PLEASANT and her sister live there, not too far from the nearby university where many of the labs grants were headquartered. They own a small townhome that's within walking distance to the school.</i>

<i>Not that it mattered much to ANGELA, at least. She spent most days going back and forth to the lab out east. She was a notorious early-riser and regardless of the commute, was one of the first ones to arrive at the lab each morning.</i>

<i>Thankfully KEVIN was on sabbatical.</i>

<br><i>KEVIN finally reaches his intended destination and descends the subway platform. It was a few stations south of where he would have met ANGELA for Sunday brunch.</i>

<i>The station is crowded and somewhat dirty, in a stagnant way that was both comforting and concerning. How long could the infrastructure remain as it had been for so long?</i>

<i>He climbs the stairs to street level and the lights fade into the discordant glow of storefronts and cellphone screens. Across the street, somewhat outside of the downtown stairwell, is fellow mage ZHANGWEI TANG.</I>
