<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Hi Cassandra. Hope you are well.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud, your father's elected trustee, wants us to make a visit to your family Manor.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Well, that should be OK.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Do you want me to come with you?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Well, if it's OK with you, I actually don't want you to come.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Just in case there's anything dangerous within.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Dangerous?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Like what?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't really know. It very well could be nothing. But it is good to play it safe.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yeah.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sorry that I haven't been back in a while.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No, no -- that's not at all what I'm trying to imply.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Your house has seen some intense strife these past years.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">If there is anything unsafe, then it would have been good you've stayed away.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That is part of why your father established the Trust; so that you could go on living your life.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">How have you been?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I've been okay, thanks for asking.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Larry's taking a break from the ghostbusting.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Has he been alright?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He was a student of my mother's. Took on the ghostbusting bit sometime after he graduated. Never used his services personally so I couldn't vouch for him in detail. But I knew you needed immediate help.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yeah, he's been doing well so far as I can tell.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He's pretty nice.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Glad to hear it.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">How are you doing?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You know,</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Without your mom.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm doing okay.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wish I'd been here to help her, but that's not how things went.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm sorry, Kev.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No worries.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She was dueling with another mage. Who knows what really happened.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I could have been seriously injured. Maybe she wouldn't have wanted that.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Maybe that's why she fought with her while I was gone. I really don't know. Maybe it was a spur-of-the-moment argument. I had thought she was friends with this particular witch.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I take it there's nothing in her records, either?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Nothing.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">My mother wasn't the type to keep a diary. Not that I'm sure I'd look into it even if she had. Bad things can come to those who don't respect the wishes of the recently departed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I am at a loss. She wasn't particularly prone to fits of anger, either, which is what makes the duel very strange.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But it is what it is. Is there anything you want me to retrieve from your Manor?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Personal effects?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No, I don't think so.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think I got everything I wanted before Dad died. And the rest of it... I don't know what I want to do with it.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I know I want to involve Alexander.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Oh, I also needed to let you know / ask permission --</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wanted to bring some of my friends along with me to the Manor.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Would that be alright by you?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric and Roxanne.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Are they...?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Vampires?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yeah, they are.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sometimes we don't get out much. And we fear for our lives more than you might imagine.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Were you friends with them back... when...?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric, yeah.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Roxanne is one of the Younger.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She's about my age but was turned only a couple years ago. She never knew me when I suffered from the Compulsion.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">How did they take it?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric, I mean.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I mean, I guess it couldn't have been too bad since you two are still friends.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was a bit hard on him but he understood.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He's had a number of bad experiences with wizards so he's generally not a fan of their kind.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think he feels like he can trust me because we both understand what it is to suffer the Compulsion.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cassandragoth.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CASSANDRA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You just... don't feel the need anymore?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That's incredible.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think about it from time to time but, no, I'm not Addicted as I once was.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's like having been given a choice I was never before given.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Every day I can make a choice. And I do.</p>
