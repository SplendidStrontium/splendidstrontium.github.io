<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That's wonderful news.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Although I feel obligated to comment --</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"a long time" is simply relative</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Fair enough.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It wasn't a long one, or very detailed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But it's something.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc, you still been having nightmares?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc1.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">What's it to you</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think the two are related.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc1.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No I haven't been having any nightmares.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No dreams, either.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was early evening. I was outside. It was definitely fall, there was a sort of dim glow to the air such that you only get in fall. A long shadow through the buildings and trees. And the air smelled clean.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was alone; I felt lonely.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was outside at the edge of a parking lot. There might have been a sign nearby, and I felt as if people were supposed to meet me here. A kiosk of sorts, I don't know, a farmstand. something like that. I knew a lot of people were going to walk by and meet me here.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was darkening quickly.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A haggard woman came by. Perhaps she was homeless; she seemed destitute for some reason I'm not entirely sure of. I can't remember her face, perhaps I had trouble looking her in the face, I'm not sure.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was selling things at this kiosk below the sign. I had an elevated shallow crate, large and wide, in which were a number of objects precious to me.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I felt less than generous toward her.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She wanted a deck of cards that I had in the bin. I didn't want to give it away. It had depicted on its faces places here in NYC. The Empire State Building, stuff like that.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I resisted, or rather, tried to resist. But I knew I had no legit reason to refuse this woman what she was asking.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I felt that I must be on my best behavior; I was trying to impress the Sky God or something. To do better, to be better, than I had been being. She wanted something and it was only my own greed keeping me from giving it to her.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">So I gave her the deck of cards, even if begrudgingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc1.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">What kind of cards?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Well, I think it was an ordinary set of 52. But there was something special about the cards and my attachment was more than you'd think. I seemed to want to use the cards for something.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Maybe a tarot?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't know.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I left soon afterward to go to an office supply store, a STAPLES or something like it.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was dark here too.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I looked for the place playing cards would be, but the only place I found them was in a basket by the register.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">How could this be it, I thought, so I looked around the store but it was cluttered and disorganized so I didn't find anything.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Oh, and I was looking for a pencil, but the store didn't seem to have those in an easily located place, either.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/roxanne-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ROXANNE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Was there anyone in the store?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No... I don't think so.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But something was keeping me from navigating the store very quickly or easily.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That's it.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vlad-inctb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's more than you sold.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was OK.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I'm glad to see that I overcame my greed and gave the cards to the woman.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/georgehenry.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GEORGEHENRY//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And what of the cards?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Well, I think I was gonna go back to buy the ones from the first basket I saw them in.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Maybe I didn't want them, exactly, or didn't want the plain set. I did think they were going to be gone, maybe sold out.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I didn't expect to find tarot cards -- </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You know, maybe they were hearkening back to a set I know of...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kev, do you know which deck I'm talking about?</p>

<br/><i>KEVIN MARSCAPONE leaves the chat and picks up his cellphone, which had been buzzing urgently while CEDRIC's messages had been pouring in.</i>

<i>He rarely regarded a phonecall as strictly an emergency; But this one he wanted to return in good time.</i>

<i>He swipes open the phone and returns the call.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> UNFORTUNATELY NOT. 

> I WASN'T HERE WHEN IT HAPPENED.

> GEORGE HENRY WAS, BUT I WASN'T.

> BUT HE DIDN'T GET INVOLVED. AND I'M GLAD FOR IT.

> THEY MADE A MESS OF THE SCHOOL. I STILL HAVEN'T GOT IT ALL CLEANED UP YET. 

> MOST OF IT, BUT NOT EVERYTHING.

> YOU'RE WELCOME TO ANY OF HER BELONGINGS, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

> SPELLBOOKS. BAUBLES. JEWELRY.

> I'M SURE SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO HAVE YOUR PICK.

### TZU ###

> NOTHING COMES TO MIND IMMEDIATELY BUT...

### TZU ###

### TZU ###

> DOES SHE HAVE ANY FAMILY?

### KEVIN ###
