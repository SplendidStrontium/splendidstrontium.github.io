<P style="text-decoration: underline;">| + Junior's State of the Union </p>

* genetics appear to be off; Emmitt is unable to select Elven ears despite having been born with them.
* at some point when he was a child, they borked off him. Boo.
* yes, he is a spell-caster, again, cannot select the ears.
* additionally, a number of skin-tone options are unavailable to him. So we went with blue. Other options were green, red, various shades of grey...
* his aunt has, and may select, purple skin-tone as well as a number of additional miscellaneous skin-tones. His aunt and his father are identical clones.
* His mother was a Mundane.
* Eri still does not yet know plentiful needs despite having filled up her entire tree of specialization points. 
* Servos can build fitness skill; in fact, Lore seems to enjoy this activity.
* I would remark fitness for Servos should probably be an enhancement rather than something they actively do.
* two children reside at the Charm Mansion: Catherine and Anastasia "Charm".
* one child has 'good' trait, the other has 'insider' trait. They are fraternal twins.
* at least one child has elven ears (despite her parents not having them), the other may as well but her hair makes it difficult to see.
* Trente earned Vampiric Speed, making her one of the only females in the save file to possess it (the first being Lilith Vatore).
* Trente is working on Serial Romantic - Player aspiration. First two victims, er, lovers, err, associates are Caleb Vatore and Lenard Trelaine.
* Lilith Pleasant made the honor of third first kiss (I kissed a girl and I liked it).
* The children in this household have aged up unnaturally quickly; just a year ago the girls were in diapers as of a report given in [CEDRIC: THEFT]({% post_url /fpmc-act-02/2021-03-08-cedric-theft %}), and Emmitt was a young child in [JUNIOR: TRUTHY]({% post_url /fpmc-act-02/2021-04-08-junior-truthy %}).
* How does the mind age up in a condensed growth cycle? How much of brain growth is acquiring knowledge and how much is physiological? Can the two processes be separated?
* Many people have had their relationships erased; not sure if this is because of vampire involvement or just game borking. Perkins and Weaslie were victims of the erasure, which was fine since it happens to be story-appropriate. Charm Mansion was also subject to the issue; had to do introductions as soon as I loaded up the house. Goofy.
* Probably due to too many Sims or something. Maybe just can't be helped with the way that I play.
* Trente Gagarin is supposed to be relatively famous. Can she get that way being a Vampire? I was going to work her through the acting aspiration and career.
* I have been working with silver being the magical antithesis of vampiricly-reflected photons. 
* Therefore a CCD without silver, or an aluminum-backed mirror, should have no issue showing the photons reflected off of a Vampire.
* Does a Vampire cast a shadow?
