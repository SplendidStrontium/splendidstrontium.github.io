### // OLD GALANTOME ESTATE //

<br><i>Nearly two months have passed since Kevin Marscapone has given the stray comic books to Larry and Cassandra Goth. Supposedly they were gifts given many years ago, a kind presentation of diplomacy under the roof of the Magicademy. They still bore the marks of their giver and would help sway a scry from empty to successful, if only they could put together the rest of the constituent parts.</i>

<i>So far, they've sat in a neat pile on top of his dresser and waited through the holidays.</i>

<i>Perhaps he'd hear from Hermione and none of this would be necessary.</i>

<i>Perhaps.</i>

<BR><I>Larry fishes around in his pocket for a small business card with a name, address, a phone number scrawled on the back in a ballpoint pen.</i>

<i>He reads the name aloud carefully.</i>

#### LARRY

> "DOCTOR ABRAHAM VAN HELSING".
