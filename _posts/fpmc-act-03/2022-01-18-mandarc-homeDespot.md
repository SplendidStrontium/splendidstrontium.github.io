<BR><I>When I finally leave the safety of the computer, I have lost track of where the little one is. I think, and I listen.</i>

<i>I hear his voice attempting command steadily and repetitively coming from the pool.</i>

<i>I hope he's dressed.</i>

#### MANDARC

> EMMITT? YOU IN HERE?

#### EMMITT

> YEAH, JUST PRACTICING A FEW INCANTATIONS.

<br><i>He is.</i>

#### MANDARC

> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH LUCK ON THE CHLORINE WATER.
> 
> JUST SO YOU KNOW.

#### EMMITT

> OH, BUT I ALREADY HAD SOME LUCK EARLIER.
> 
> I'M SORRY I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE --

<BR><I>My tone changes timber to match my surprise.</i>

#### MANDARC

> YOU WERE ABLE TO ...

<BR><I>I look toward the water, somewhat murky and fading to greenish blue.</i>

#### MANDARC

> WITH THAT?

#### EMMITT

> YEAH, IT WASN'T HARD --

<BR><I>At this he lowers his voice for a self-deprecating aside.</i>

#### EMMITT

> FOR ONCE.
> 
> (brightly) YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK MUCH BETTER HERE.
> 
> IT'S ALMOST AS IF MY AUNT HAD SOMETHING IN THE AIR.
> 
> A FOG, A DRUG, SOMETHING IN THE FOOD, I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> MAYBE IT WAS FOR MY OWN GOOD THAT THE COUNT TOLD ME TO RUN AWAY.
> 
> MAYBE THEY WERE DRUGGING ME.

#### MANDARC

> MAYBE.

<br><i>Maybe we should bring Cedric?</i>

<i>No, no, no, dude's got those two new kittens now, we shouldn't bother him.</i>

#### EMMITT

> I FOUND SOME FRESH SALAD IN THE 'FRIGERATOR.
> 
> WAS THAT HIM TOO?

<BR><I>"Him" who?</i>

<i>I feign that I wasn't listening.</i>

#### MANDARC

> HMM? OH, SORRY.
> 
> SPACED OUT THERE FOR A MOMENT.

#### EMMITT

> IT'S OK. 
> 
> ...

#### MANDARC

> I WAS THINKING THAT WE SHOULD TRAVEL TO THE HOME IMPROVEMENT WAREHOUSE AND PICK UP SOME SUPPLIES TO PUT IN A SINK IN THE BARROOM.
> 
> THE HOOKUP IS ALL READY FOR US.

<BR><I>But he's less than excited about my suggestion.</i>

#### EMMITT

> GO...OUT?

#### MANDARC

> I HAVE TALKED TO THE MASTER AND WE SHOULD BE UNDER NO SERIOUS RISK TODAY.
> 
> SO LONG AS WE MAINTAIN THE PROPER PROTOCOL REGARDING COLLUSION.
> 
> WE SHOULD BE IN NO LESS DANGER THAN...THAN TYPICAL OPERATION.

#### EMMITT 

> BUT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO SCHOOL TODAY.

#### MANDARC

> THE MASTER INSTRUCTED ME THAT YOU HAD NO NEED TO ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE.
> 
> THAT YOU'VE COVERED THE GENERAL CURRICULUM.

#### EMMITT

> I JUST...
> 
> DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY'D BE SENDING COPS AFTER ME FOR TRUANCY.
> 
> IT'S TUESDAY SO EVERYONE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BE IN SCHOOL.

#### MANDARC

> IF THE MASTER SAYS WE'RE UNDER NO RISK, THEN I'M INCLINED TO BELIEVE HIM.

#### EMMITT

> ...I GUESS.
> 
> I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW, TOO, THAT I THINK YOUR REFRIGERATOR IS GONNA BLOW.
> 
> IT'S MAKING KIND OF A FUNNY SOUND.

#### MANDARC

> I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
