*****
<br><i>Rieko Yamamoto was an unusual addition to the club.</i>

<i>She believed in werewolves.</i>
<br><br>

*****
#### VAN HELSING

> WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT WEREWOLVES EXIST?

#### RIEKO

> I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. I JUST ALWAYS HAVE.

<BR><I>She was a spellcaster of some ken. But I have never heard of the werewolf outside of myth and legend. Though, that was just my own experience.</i>

#### VAN HELSING

> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN PROOF OF THE WEREWOLF?

#### RIEKO

> I'VE HAD DREAMS.

#### VAN HELSING

> YOU'VE HAD DREAMS?
> 
> PLEASE ELABORATE.

#### RIEKO

> I'VE HAD DREAMS THAT I'M BEING CHASED BY AN ENORMOUS, BESTIAL WEREWOLF.
> 
> HE'S BROWN, ENTIRELY COVERED WITH THICK FUR.

#### VAN HELSING

> AND YOU BELIEVE THE DREAMS?

<BR><I>Dream interpretation was not a forte of mine. But I was always looking to improve.</i>

#### RIEKO

> WELL, YES, IN A WAY. THEY'VE BEGUN TO LEAK OVER INTO MY WAKING THOUGHTS.
> 
> IT'S HARD NOT TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE REAL.
> 
> I FIND MYSELF LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER, WONDERING IF HE'S THERE, WATCHING ME.

#### VAN HELSING

> "HE"?

#### RIEKO

> YES, I GET THE OVERWHELMING FEELING THAT IT'S A HE, JUST WAITING TO PREY UPON ME.

#### VAN HELSING

> WHAT DOES THE WEREWOLF WANT FROM YOU?

#### RIEKO

> WHAT DOES THE WEREWOLF WANT FROM ME?
> 
> TO STOP LOOKING FOR HIM.

#### VAN HELSING

> WILL YOU GIVE THAT TO HIM?

#### RIEKO

> NO, I THINK IT'S MY DUTY TO WARN OTHERS ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF I GET KILLED IN THE PROCESS.
> 
> IT JUST FEELS LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

#### VAN HELSING

> IS THAT DREAM YOU OR WAKING YOU?

#### RIEKO

> OH, CERTAINLY WAKING ME.
> 
> DREAM ME IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF THE WEREWOLF.

<BR><I>She did not seem so terrified.</i>

#### VAN HELSING

> WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND THE WEREWOLF?

#### RIEKO

> FIND? HE FINDS ME.

#### VAN HELSING

> CAPTURE, PERHAPS.

#### RIEKO

> ME? I DON'T KNOW. 
> 
> PROBABLY TRY TO ZIPZAP IT TO DEATH BUT I DOUBT THAT WOULD WORK.

#### VAN HELSING

> HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED TO EXPERIENCE VISIONS?

#### RIEKO

> TWELVE OR THIRTEEN OR SO. I SAW A SCARY MOVIE AT MY MOM'S PLACE.

#### VAN HELSING

> AND THE MOVIE FEATURED THE WEREWOLF?

#### RIEKO

> YEAH.
> 
> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE OLD RETRO HORROR FLICKS.

#### VAN HELSING

> AND THIS MADE YOU AFRAID OF THE WEREWOLF?

#### RIEKO

> WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
> 
> THE MOVIE STUCK OUT TO ME BUT IT WAS THE RECURRING DREAMS THAT MADE ME AFRAID.

#### VAN HELSING

> YOU SAY "DREAMS", NOT "NIGHTMARES"?

#### RIEKO

> I GUESS THEY'RE NIGHTMARES, JUST...
> 
> IN THEM I'M COMPLETELY LUCID, IN CONTROL.
> 
> AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE BIT.

#### VAN HELSING

> WHAT DEFINES A NIGHTMARE FOR YOU, THEN? A VISION IN WHICH YOU'RE NOT FULLY IN CONTROL?

#### RIEKO

> YEAH, I GUESS.

#### VAN HELSING

> SO, THEN, YOU'RE IN CONTROL WHEN THE WEREWOLF APPEARS.

#### RIEKO

> YEAH, MOSTLY.
> 
> I DON'T USUALLY END UP DOING MUCH, THOUGH I'VE TRIED A FEW TIMES.
> 
> THEN I'M JUST SO AFRAID THAT I WAKE MYSELF UP.
> 
> I'VE TRIED TO KEEP MYSELF IN THE DREAM BUT SO FAR I'VE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.

#### VAN HELSING

> VERY INTERESTING.

#### RIEKO

> HM?

<BR><I>If it was true that she truly could walk the Dream, then her dreams were more than idle happenstance.</i>

#### VAN HELSING

> YOU ALWAYS SAVE YOURSELF FROM INEVITABLE DOOM BY BREAKING DOWN THE RULES OF THE PLANE IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF.
> 
> YOU WAKE UP BEFORE ANY HARM CAN COME TO YOU.

#### RIEKO

> YEAH I GUESS SO.
> 
> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SCAREDY CAT.

#### VAN HELSING

> THERE YOU GO AGAIN, NEGATIVE FRAMING.

#### RIEKO

> SORRY.

#### VAN HELSING

> NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE BUT ALSO NO NEED TO COUCH A VICTORY IN DEFEAT.
> 
> YOU HAVE EVADED THE GRASP OF THE WEREWOLF FOR THIS LONG, ARE THERE ANY SIGNS IT MAY CHANGE?

#### RIEKO

> LIKE BAD OMENS?

#### VAN HELSING

> OR RECENT CHANGES TO THE PATTERN.

#### RIEKO

> WELL, I GET THE FEELING HE'S GETTING SMARTER.
> 
> LIKE, HE'S ABLE TO ACCESS HIS HUMAN FACULTIES WHILE SHAPESHIFTED.

#### VAN HELSING

> CAN YOU SEE HIS EYES?

#### RIEKO

> HIS EYES? OH, WELL, THEY'RE...GREEN, I THINK.
> 
> GREY?
> 
> MAYBE SOME KIND OF GREY-ISH GREEN.

#### VAN HELSING

> ARE THEY A WOLF'S EYES?

#### RIEKO

> NO, NOT REALLY.
> 
> THEY'RE HUMAN IN EXPRESSION, IN MOVEMENT.
> 
> ...OR WERE THEY BLUE?

#### VAN HELSING

> WAS IT A MAN OR A WOLF?

#### RIEKO

> A MAN-WOLF. BUT WITH A MUPPET MOUTH.

#### VAN HELSING

> SO IT'S THE MASK FROM YOUR MOVIE.

#### RIEKO

> YEAH, MAYBE. BUT IT CAN TALK. 
> 
> AND IT HAS TEETH.

#### VAN HELSING

> DO THE TEETH WORK OR ARE THEY ALSO STUFFED?

#### RIEKO

> OH, THEY WORK.
> 
> THEY EVEN SHINE.

#### VAN HELSING

> ARE THEY SHARP?

#### RIEKO

> YES.
> 
> SMALL, BUT SHARP.
