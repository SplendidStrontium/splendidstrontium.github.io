Dear Caleb,

### // STRAUD MANSION //

<br><i>I wake up that morning groggy and stupified. It is an unwelcome feeling but one I must endure if I am able to see the light of day. I am upstairs; I have taken to sleeping in the bed as the dog prefers it.</i>

<i>I make my offering to the Gods and a memory comes flooding back to me.</i>

<i>I must write Caleb, for if I don't, who will? </i>

<i>I set my hair in place and go upstairs to compose my plea.</i>

<br>FROM: VLADISLAUS STRAUD (personal)

TO: CALEB VATORE (personal)

Dear Caleb,

I have brought the boy Emmitt Skinner to stay with us in the Forgotten Hallow. I am telling you this because of your courtship with the Moon Priestess.

Some feel you may be inclined to follow in your father's footsteps ...

<br><i>But I can already feel his heated denial.</i>

#### CALEB

> MY FATHER WAS NOT LOYAL TO YOU, YOU WERE LOYAL TO MY FATHER.

#### STRAUD

> OH NO, NO.
> 
> MY BOY.
> 
> IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
> 
> YOUR FATHER MADE THE OATH OF APPEARANCES WHEN WE WERE JUST ENTERING INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER. IT WAS A PACT OF MUTUAL PROTECTION AND IT BENEFITED BOTH OF US TO MAKE IT.
> 
> SEE, YOUR FATHER HAD A GREAT DEAL OF OLD ENEMIES AND I WAS SUFFERING UNDER A LACK OF ENERGY AFTER I ROSE FROM A LONG SLUMBER.
> 
> IT WAS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR US TO PRESENT APPEARANCES AS WE DID.

<BR><I>I focus my thoughts and return to the letter.</i>

<BR>It was me who told the boy to leave.

She may retaliate in anger and try to hurt you, Caleb. Because she fears your loyalty lies with me.

But your loyalties lie with whoever and whomever you please. You are a free agent, Caleb, and you may pledge yourself to whoever and whomever you please.

<br><i>At this line, Caleb starts to rage.</i>

#### CALEB

> OF COURSE I'M MY OWN MAN AND CAN GO ANYWHERE AND WHEREVER I PLEASE, OLD MAN.

<BR><I>At this, I know I've lost him. I've put my foot in my mouth.</i>

<i>Anything further I say to the young man will go in one ear and out the other so I should just save my breath.</i>

<br>Your friend McKenna Bernstein came by the Toast & Caramel. I think she was looking for you but wouldn't say.

She'd appreciate your joke about "Astromy". I know I found it rather funny.

<br><i>Should I tell him the truth; that the Moon Priestess was in heat and he must stay away for the fate of our planet? That any offspring born of that woman would damn us all and place a pile of tokens in the enemy's pile that it would take years, if not eons, to undo? That the fate of us all rested in avoiding that most wretched of acts?</i>

...

<i>No. That is a story for another day.</i>
