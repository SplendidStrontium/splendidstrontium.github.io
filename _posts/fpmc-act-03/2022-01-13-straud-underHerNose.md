<br><i>As with most things, when asked "Why?" I simply respond, "Why Not?"</i>

<i>Or, at least, I did, once upon a time.</i>

<i>Emmitt Skinner learned today that his mother was named Cassie Skinner.</i>

<i>He knows because I told him.</i>

### // CHARM MANSION //

<BR><I>When I warp into Emmitt Skinner's bedroom, he's writing in a journal. It is the first thing my eyes flicker to, against my better design. In ballpoint pen, he's written the words 'WORST LOVE DAY EVER' and underlined the last word a number of times, pressing hard enough into the paper to cause indentation.</i>

<i>He doesn't seem to recognize my face but his exposure to magic has left him with nonchalance and a difficulty to surprise.</i>

#### EMMITT

> EXCUSE ME, SIR.
> 
> CAN I HELP YOU?

#### STRAUD

> WHY ARE YOU STAYING HERE?

<BR><I>He doesn't know what else to say, so he parrots the question back to me.</i>

#### EMMITT

> W-WHY AM I STAYING HERE?
> 
> I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> BECAUSE I'M SUPPOSED TO.

#### STRAUD

> IS ERI O'LANNA YOUR MOTHER?

#### EMMITT

> NO.

#### STRAUD

> IS TRENTE GAGARIN YOUR FATHER?

#### EMMITT

> NO.

#### STRAUD

> THEN WHY DO YOU STAY HERE?

<BR><I>He pauses, considering, face beginning to twitch in embarrassment.</i>

#### EMMITT

> I -- I DON'T KNOW.
> 
> THEY FEED ME.
> 
> THEY TAKE CARE OF ME.

#### STRAUD

> DO YOU TRUST THEM?

#### EMMITT

> W-WHAT?

<BR><I>But I'm sure he's heard me.</i>

#### STRAUD

> DO YOU TRUST THEM?

<BR><I>He doesn't want to conjure the truth, but I want him to come to it on his own.</i>

#### EMMITT

> ...NO.

<BR><I>He hangs his head in shame.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOU'VE RECEIVED CLEARANCE TO ATTEND THE SPICE FESTIVAL TODAY, HAVE YOU NOT?
> 
> I WANT YOU TO GO.
> 
> MY ASSOCIATE WILL PICK YOU UP.
> 
> YOU WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE AND NEVER RETURN.

<BR><I>With that, I hand him a credit card with his name on it and warp out just the way that I came.</i>
