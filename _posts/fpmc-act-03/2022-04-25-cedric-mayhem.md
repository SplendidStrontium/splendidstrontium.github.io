<br><i>Charlotte, formally known as Charlotte Deadeye, was an aged child of Straud's. She was an alleged princess of some sort, the daughter of a long-dead Native king. She and her brother Jude were descendants of years of prosperity and enjoyed relative security within its shadows.</i>

<i>The siblings had a number of apartments in the city but today Caleb and I were planning on meeting in Brooklyn. </i>

<i>I had my own theories that Charlotte maintained this safehouse as a way to get closer to the mage Tatanya Oborovsky, the sister of my deceased mentor. I wondered idly if the woman was actually interested in a creature of the night by her own virtues or if she regarded the vampress as yet another of her projects.</i>

<i>But I suspected I was never to know the truth.</i>

<i>As I traveled through the train empty-handed, I was grateful I'd given the fruit business back to the Vatores. It was a risk I didn't feel up to taking lately, not with my other goals.</i>

<i>I exit the train station and take a short walk. Brooklyn always surprises me with its density. Soon, within my view comes Caleb in his scarlet coat.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HEY CALEB.
> 
> HOW'S IT SHAKING?

<BR><I>He's carrying a satchel that I assume bears a clutch of the pale lavender fruit.</i>

#### CALEB

> I DIDN'T EVEN THINK SHE LIKED THE FRUIT.

<BR><I>I refrained from gossipping about the tastes of my acquaintances.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> COULDN'T TELL YA.

#### CALEB

> YOU DIDN'T TELL HER ABOUT MY FATHER, DID YOU?

#### CEDRIC

> CALEB, EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

#### CALEB

> I DON'T MEAN THAT, I MEANT...

#### CEDRIC

> YOUR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION?

#### CALEB

> I GUESS.

#### CEDRIC

> NO, NOT A WORD.
> 
> I DON'T THINK SHE HAS ANY IDEA OR SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU.

#### CALEB

> I GUESS NOT.

#### CEDRIC

> I'M JUST STRICKEN THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN IMAGINATION GAMES.
> 
> IT'S A PITY YOUR FATHER DIDN'T SEE THE MERIT.
> 
> ANYWAY.
> 
> MAY THE DEPARTED REST PEACEFULLY.
> 
> HOW'S THE MOON PRIESTESS?

#### CALEB

> FINE. 
> 
> WHY?

#### CEDRIC

> YOU KNOW SHE HAS A THING FOR STRAUD.

#### CALEB

> WHAT?

#### CEDRIC

> PAST OR PRESENT, I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW BUT IT'S THE ONLY SENSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR HER BEHAVIOR.

<BR><I>We walk for a moment in silence.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY TALKED TO STRAUD MUCH ABOUT IT BUT IT'S MY HUNCH, YEAH.
> 
> BUT I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE'S GOTTEN OVER IT.
> 
> STRAUD IS A LITTLE OLD FOR HER.

#### CALEB

> HOW OLD IS HE, ANYWAY?

#### CEDRIC

> OLDER THAN SIN.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>Charlotte's flat is modest, to say the least. the walls of the building's hallways are coated with an indistinct grime possible only by years of neglect. The paint is peeling in some places and the elevator acts sluggishly. But it's no worse than any middle-class urban abode.</i>

<i>She answers the door wearing an outfit from the clearance rack at Hot Topic.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> CALEB, CEDRIC. WELCOME.
> 
> PLEASE COME IN.

#### CALEB

> HI CHARLOTTE.
> 
> HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

#### CHARLOTTE

> DOING WELL, DOING WELL.

#### CEDRIC

> HEY.

<BR><I>Any mortal who stepped inside this apartment would have been unnerved. It had an air of otherworldliness to its purple and gold color palette. The vampress had spared no expense in making the flat able to serve only her specific needs. There was no buzz of a refrigerator, no stove to dispense the natural gas the city-dwellers used to cook food. Instead, there was a small corner of cabinetry that barely qualified as a kitchenette. A drip coffeemaker sat alone on top of a dishwasher.</i>

<i>Where a dining room might have collected was a large bar forming an arc against a corner.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> CAN I OFFER YOU SOMETHING REFRESHING?

#### CEDRIC

> WE GOING OUT?

#### CHARLOTTE

> I WAS GOING TO STAY IN TONIGHT.

#### CEDRIC

> GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU CALLED US OVER.

<BR><I>Caleb tries to defuse the conversation.</i>

#### CALEB

> I BROUGHT SOME OF THE NEW HARVEST.

<BR><I>He wanders over toward the back of the bar. There is a large mirror allowing one to see the colorful bottles of liquid beneath. But Caleb did not appear in its reflection.</i>

#### CALEB

> CARE IF I MIX SOMETHING UP?

#### CHARLOTTE

> PLEASE DO.

<BR><I>Glasses clink as Caleb prepares three drinks of freshly squeezed juice. He seems to have taken some of my pointers.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> YOU KNOW, CEDRIC.
> 
> I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU THIS BUT YOU HAVE ALWAYS REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE.

#### CEDRIC

> OH YEAH?
> 
> WHO?

#### CHARLOTTE

> NO ONE YOU'D KNOW.
> 
> A FRIEND I HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.
> 
> SHE HAD BRIGHT BLONDE HAIR NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.

#### CEDRIC

> I APPRECIATE THE COMPLIMENT.

#### CHARLOTTE

> IS IT NATURAL?

#### CEDRIC

> YOU MEAN IS IT A DYE JOB?
> 
> NO, I DON'T DYE MY HAIR.

<BR><I>My thoughts wander back to a recent conversation with Seven. She, too, had asked after my near-platinum hair. But she had a different angle.</i>

> #### SEVEN
> 
> > IT'S NOT TRUE FOR YOU, IS IT?
> > 
> > THAT YOU CAN'T CUT YOUR HAIR?
> 
> #### CEDRIC
> 
> > MY HAIR GROWS.
> > 
> > MY FINGERNAILS GROW.
> 
> #### SEVEN
> 
> > YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
> > 
> > ME TOO.
> > 
> > I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD WHAT ANNE RICE DECIDED TO DO IN HER WORLD.
> > 
> > WHAT WITH THE HAIR AND FINGERNAILS AND ALL.
> 
> <BR><I>Who had these mortals known? What had they seen that caused them to come up with these non-sensical explanations?</i>
> 
> #### CEDRIC
> 
> > PERHAPS SHE WAS TRYING TO GRASP AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CROSSOVER.
> > 
> > IN HER WORLD, THE UNDEAD ARE IMMORTAL AVATARS OF WHO THEY WERE AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH.
> > 
> > THEY CANNOT CHANGE NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY WISH IT.
> 
> <BR><I>It's a dismal world view but it has a certain kernel of truth.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL, MY FRIEND.

<BR><I>Caleb is still fussing around with his titration.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> CALEB WAS TELLING ME YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GAMING.
> 
> MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN A ONE-OFF TO TRY IT OUT.

#### CHARLOTTE

> A ONE-OFF?

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH.
> 
> JUST A SINGLE-SESSION ADVENTURE WHERE YOU CAN TRY OUT A CHARACTER AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE THE GAME.

#### CHARLOTTE

> WELL, IT'S NOT JUST ME. 
> 
> I WAS THINKING OF INVITING A FRIEND OF MINE.
> 
> HE NEEDS SOME FRIENDS.

#### CEDRIC

> WELL, I DON'T DM FOR JUST ANYONE.

<BR><I>Suddenly a knock comes to the door. Caleb, just having finished his preparation, looks up in alarm.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> I'LL GET IT.

<BR><I>She answers the door but shuts it behind her in an effort to keep her conversation from us. It is clear she's keeping some secret above and beyond the usual.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU DONE WITH THOSE DRINKS YET?

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>When Charlotte rejoins us, she looks flustered.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

#### CEDRIC

> HAVE A DRINK FIRST. 
> 
> IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

<BR><I>We tap our glasses against each other in a toast.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> TO CONFESSIONS.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I'M SORRY I HAVE TO INVOLVE YOU BOYS IN MY PROBLEMS, I JUST DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO TELL THE COUNT YET.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU ARE HIS DAUGHTER.
> 
> YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE HONEST WITH HIM.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I WILL...JUST...THIS BECAME A TIME-SENSITIVE MATTER.

<BR><I>There is a pause in the conversation.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU CONVERTED SOMEONE, DIDN'T YOU.

<BR><I>She looks stunned.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> STRAUD DOESN'T KNOW I KNOW HOW.
> 
> HE NEVER TAUGHT US.

#### CEDRIC

> HE DOESN'T USUALLY.
> 
> FOR THIS VERY REASON.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I JUST THOUGHT I'D BRING HIM INTO THE FOLD.
> 
> IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT HAPPENED?

#### CHARLOTTE

> HE WAS GOING TO GO TO THE POLICE!

#### CEDRIC

> HE FIGURED YOU OUT?

#### CHARLOTTE

> YEAH.
> 
> I FUCKED UP.

#### CEDRIC

> I'LL SAY.
> 
> WAS THAT HIM?

#### CHARLOTTE

> AT THE DOOR?
> 
> YEAH.

#### CEDRIC

> JESUS CHRIST.
> 
> WELL, YOU NEED TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

#### CHARLOTTE

> HIS MOTHER LIVES ACROSS THE HALL.

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT'S THE SCHMUCK'S NAME?

#### CHARLOTTE

> HIS NAME IS RAJ RASOYA.

#### CEDRIC

> GREAT. JUST GREAT.
> 
> JUST WHAT THIS WORLD NEEDS: MORE YOUNGLINGS.

#### CHARLOTTE

> HE MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD ADDITION TO THE CREW.
> 
> HE'S AN ACCOMPLISHED CHEF.

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOU THOUGHT YOU'D OFFLOAD YOUR NEW BUNDLE OF JOY ON US?

#### CHARLOTTE

> I NEED HELP.

#### CEDRIC

> I'LL SAY YOU DO.
> 
> DOES THE WORD "MASQUERADE" MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
> 
> WEAR A FUCKING MASK.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I TRIED!
> 
> HE JUST HAD ME AT EVERY ANGLE.

#### CEDRIC

> DAMNIT, CHARLOTTE.
> 
> DAMNIT.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I'M SORRY.

#### CEDRIC

> SORRY DOESN'T CUT IT!

#### CALEB

> ACCIDENTS HAPPEN, CEDRIC.

#### CEDRIC

> NO, ACCIDENTS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.
> 
> THESE THINGS COME FROM AGGRAVATED NEGLECT.

<BR><I>The trio are silent in somber reflection.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WELL D&D IS ONE THING.
> 
> I RECENTLY RECEIVED A NEW ASSIGNMENT SO I'M NOT AVAILABLE TO ADOPT A TODDLER.
> 
> YOU'LL HAVE TO STEP IT UP.
> 
> DOES YOUR BROTHER KNOW?

#### CHARLOTTE

> YEAH, JUDE KNOWS.

#### CEDRIC

> AND WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY?

#### CHARLOTTE

> HE THINKS WE SHOULD BRING IN STRAUD.

#### CEDRIC

> WELL, YEAH, THAT MUCH IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
> 
> NO ONE GETS PROTECTION WITHOUT AN INTERVIEW.
> 
> BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S READY FOR AN INTERVIEW. 
> 
> HE'S A LITTLE...UNORTHODOX.

#### CEDRIC

> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
> 
> HE'LL ADJUST.
> 
> WE ALL DID.
> 
> I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET THIS HAPPEN.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I THOUGHT, MAYBE, HE COULD HELP US DEVELOP THE FRUIT.

#### CEDRIC

> WE DON'T NEED TO DEVELOP THE FRUIT.
> 
> WE'VE ALREADY GOT ALL THE DEVELOPMENT WE NEED.

#### CHARLOTTE

> BUT HEAR ME OUT!
> 
> IF THE REVEAL REALLY IS COMING THEN WE'LL HAVE ONE MORE WAY TO KEEP US SAFE FROM DANGER.

#### CEDRIC

> THE FRUIT IS NOT MEANT TO BE OUR SOLE SOURCE OF SUSTINANCE. 
> 
> YOU KNOW THIS. SURELY STRAUD HAS TOLD YOU.

#### CHARLOTTE

> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VATORE FAMILY?

#### CEDRIC

> WHAT ABOUT THE VATORE FAMILY?

#### CHARLOTTE

> ISN'T IT TRUE THEY NEVER PREYED ON THE LIVING?

#### CEDRIC

> CALEB?

#### CALEB

> WELL, I NEVER SAW FATHER ENTERTAIN A MORTAL.

#### CHARLOTTE

> SURELY IT'S POSSIBLE.

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOU MEAN TO DENY YOUR SON HIS BIRTHRIGHT?

<BR><I>She winces.</i>

#### CHARLOTTE

> DON'T SAY THAT.

#### CEDRIC

> SAY WHAT?
> 
> HE'S YOUR CHARGE.
> 
> YOU DID THIS.

#### CHARLOTTE

> OKAY, OKAY. 
> 
> YOU'RE RIGHT.

#### CEDRIC

> SOME MOTHER YOU'RE SHAPING UP TO BE.

#### CHARLOTTE

> I DIDN'T MAKE HIM SUSPECT ME!

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOUR LIES WERE INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED.
> 
> FOR SOMEONE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE AND PEDIGREE, I'D EXPECT MORE.
> 
> IT'S NO WONDER STRAUD DOESN'T TEACH THE RITUAL.
> 
> JUST HOW MANY OF OUR KIND DO YOU EXPECT THIS CITY TO CONTAIN?
> 
> EVERY NEW ADDITION IS ONE MORE WEAK LINK IN THE CHAIN.

#### CALEB

> HAVE A LITTLE PITY, CEDRIC.
> 
> IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS GUY HAD CHARLOTTE BACKED UP INTO A CORNER.

#### CEDRIC

> MY PITY, YOU HAVE. 
> 
> I DON'T RELISH THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO CONTAIN A YOUNGLING WITH DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.
> 
> MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE FRIGHTENING NEXT TIME.

#### CHARLOTTE

> THERE WON'T BE A NEXT TIME.

#### CEDRIC

> I HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE THAT'S TRUE.
