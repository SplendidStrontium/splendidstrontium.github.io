I suppose it's come time, as it does every turning of the Earth, to create a pie to give to others. Now, you'll remember, as I know you should, that the creation of pie was created to create more from a small set of objects than would ordinarily be thought able. You know. "create something from nothing". Well such a thing, as you know, is not permissible via modern Physics, but let's pretend as a social experiment. 

"Pi Day" originates from the very-early-twentifirst-cent'ry: A celebration in March to honor π : the ratio between circumference and diameter that exists in a Perfect Circle. 

It has become customary in the modern age to celebrate the occasion of this irrational number on March 14°. Hence, today I present the 2π/2.
