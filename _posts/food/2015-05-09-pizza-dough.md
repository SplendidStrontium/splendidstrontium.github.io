* stir `¼c warm water` & `1tsp honey` (I use the lowest setting on my convection oven)
* add `1pkg / 2¼ tsp yeast` & let sit
* add `1c room temp water` & `1tbsp olive oil` to yeast
* combine `2c semolina` & `1c a.p. flour`
* add yeast in bits until ball forms (use mixer?)
* let dough rest 5-10min, then mix again; should be lightly tacky
* let rise until doubled
* divide dough in half.  let rest & work, or freeze for up to 2mo
