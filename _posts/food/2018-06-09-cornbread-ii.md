_After making the old recipe a few times, I made some refinements. If you keep leaf lard in your kitchen, please feel free to substitute up to 30g of the butter for lard._

* in large mixing bowl, combine `160g cornmeal`, `110g ap flour`, `60g corn flour`, `100g sugar`, `2g b.soda`, `5g b.powder`, `10g salt`
* make a hollow in the center of the dry ingredients
* pour in `1c milk`, `½c butter`, the latter softened to room temperature or just melted, and `¼c oil` such as walnut, coconut, or even olive
* roughly whip wet ingredients together
* stir dry ingredients into wet
* careful not to overbeat, stir in `2 eggs` and stir until creamy and fairly homogenous
* while mixing, stir in `1tsp apple cider vinegar`
* bake 20min or until done at `400°`
