SETTING: 'Marscapone Apartments', Neucrest<br/>
YEAR: 2020, summer

<center>~</center>

<br><i>CEDRIC rises from his nightly meditation. He is in a dark basement; the simple coffin of dark jungle wood is one of the few features of the cavern.</i>

<i>The young blond man wears a frown. He's had an unpleasant dream. He has no hesitation and begins talking to himself.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> THE CAR... ALWAYS WITH THE CAR... ALWAYS LOSING IT.

<br><i>His nightmare again had him as a steward of the family car -- which he lost due to his own neglectful assumptions.</i>

<i>In the dream, he'd been at a convention center meeting with an old schoolmate. Someone he'd known of, but, had they ever spoken?</i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHY HIM? WE WEREN'T EVEN FRIENDS.

<br><i>CEDRIC seems preoccupied and begins pacing about the space. There is a simple computer on a desk in the corner -- it is a beige plastic reminiscent of at least twenty years prior. </i>

#### CEDRIC

> WHY HIM, VINCE? WHY HIM?!

<br><i>CEDRIC allows a moment of silence after he yells into the air. The world of Dream - Elysion - does not show itself trivially to the dreamer. Nor does its Prince, the elder Marscapone, act on whim to his disciples.</i>

<i>CEDRIC buries his fingers in his light hair and crumples to the ground in dry tears. In the distance, a bird's tinny melody silences the crickets.</i>
