<br><i>CEDRIC's eyes fly open. His foray into Elysion -- the Dream -- has concluded. He  just barely loses his sense of self while he travels; a brief respite from the endless chains of reality. Since accepting the Gift, true sleep as the Mortals experience has been unknown to him.</i>

<i>Each waking, CEDRIC reviews what he's seen of Elysion. He speaks aloud into the dim basement, as if speaking to his now-deceased Mentor. Light trickles in through side-windows, illuminating speckles of dust stagnating in the air.</i>

#### CEDRIC

<br><i>A flip, a few button presses, and the alarm is silenced. He grimaces, if only slightly. The time is 6:30 AM.</i>
