*****
<br><i>Running. The wolves surround me as we weave in and out of trees in the dwindling wilderness. Most of it is new growth but I don't have time to linger on the Mortals' sins. I follow the path the wolves have set before me and ask no questions. They will know if my faith wavers. And I have no intention of making them regret their show of forgiveness.</i>

<i>There are new personalities in their family. Voices I do not recognize. But each welcome me and assist my clumsy movements. I am awash in gratitude but I try not to be overcome with disbelief. It is not like them to dwell excessively in submissiveness.</i>

<i>I think of Myrtle. I think of our school. I think of Kevin. I do not know much of Trelaine or what obstacles lay before me. But I have brought with me every advantage I could find.</i>

<i>I am tired, but I keep running.</i>
<br>

*****
<br><i>Hidden by a thicket of trees is the Crimson Tower. It reaches into the darkened sky with a foreboding presence that gives me pause.</i>

<i>My chaperones begin a howl that echoes from each in their own turn.</i>

<i>This is where my son is being held.</i>

<i>I shed my wolf form and don the guise of the woman my wife has shown me.</i>

<i>I do not even know her name. But I will have to improvise.</i>

<i>I am trying to collect myself in this new pair of shoes when the front door opens. Into the cool night air comes a man in a set of scrubs.</i>

<i>I am fortunate to lay eyes upon a nametag as he approaches.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> HEY NATHAN. 
> 
> I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. 
> 
> I LOCKED MYSELF OUT. 
> 
> CAN YOU LET ME BACK IN?

#### NATHAN

> I THOUGHT YOUR SHIFT WAS OVER.
> 
> WORKING OVERTIME?

#### AUTUMN

> YOU KNOW IT.

#### NATHAN

> YOU'RE ALWAYS PICKING UP AFTER LENARD.

#### AUTUMN

> HE'S A BUSY MAN.
> 
> I DON'T ENVY HIS SCHEDULE.

#### NATHAN

> HOW'S THE KID?

<BR><I>My supposed friend lights a cigarette. I will have to wait patiently for him to finish.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> KID'S OKAY. 
> 
> OBSTINATE LITTLE BRAT THOUGH.

<BR><I>He laughs.</i>

#### NATHAN

> AREN'T THEY ALL.
> 
> MINE ARE THE SAME WAY.

<BR><I>He takes a long drag of his cigarette.</i>

#### NATHAN

> IS IT TRUE HE'S THE MISSING LINK?

#### AUTUMN

> I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
> 
> THE DOCTOR SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A SPECIAL INTEREST IN HIM, THOUGH.
> 
> I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

#### NATHAN

> I WISH I COULD BE A FLY ON THE WALL.

#### AUTUMN

> FOR THE DOCTOR'S MEETINGS?
> 
> I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST AS DULL AS WE FEAR.

#### NATHAN

> YOU WANT ANY OF THIS?

<BR><I>He offers his cigarette to me.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
> 
> I'M TRYING TO QUIT.

#### NATHAN

> YOU'RE TRYING TO QUIT?
> 
> GOD HELP US ALL.

<BR><I>Yes, God help us all.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>My heart flutters a bit as we move toward the entrance to the tower. I could mimic the form of the nurse but I had no faked credentials.</i>

<i>Nathan, on the other hand, thoughtlessly scans his badge to allow us entrance to the building. Through the door is a second stopping point, one beset with a fingerprint reader.</i>

<i>This, I could do.</i>

#### NATHAN

> TRY NOT TO LOCK YOURSELF OUT AGAIN.
> 
> YOU WORK YOURSELF TOO HARD.

#### AUTUMN

> SAME TO YOU. 
> 
> THANKS AGAIN.

#### NATHAN

> NO PROBLEM.

<BR><I>He turns away and leaves down a long hallway.</i>

<i>I'm alone. But I still cannot look suspicious. Where are the patient rooms? The nurses' station? I have no choice but to walk around the hallways looking for a hint.</i>

<i>I quickly find the staff lockers, but of course without knowledge of which locker she owns, let alone a working combination, the find is useless to me. Nurses shuttle past me, engaged in their own tasks. I, too, have my own task.</i>

<i>I find a small bathroom noted for use by the staff. I need privacy if I'm to unleash my secret weapon.</i>

<i>My hands quiver as I place them upon my chest. My special payload. I gather breath in my lungs and pluck the explosives from their hiding place upon my body. For such a foreign object to be able to be masked by my metamorphosis, they had to feel like a personal effect.</i>

<i>I'd needed them.</i>

<i>I depress a few buttons and a timer begins to count down on the digital display. I set the devices in the room, one atop the toilet and the other within the walls of the sink.</i>

#### VINCENT

> HERE YOU ARE, TRELAINE. I WISH YOU THE BREAST.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>I am meandering around a hallway when the detonation occurs. Alarms immediately blare and the sound of panic echoes through the facility.</i>

<i>I seize the moment to run toward the nurses' station. Sitting with a dumbfounded expression on his face is a man watching the security cameras. He looks to me in desperation.</i>

#### MAN

> WHAT'S GOING ON?
> 
> DO WE EVACUATE?

#### AUTUMN

> OF COURSE WE EVACUATE!
> 
> OPEN THE DOOR OF PATIENT A!

#### MAN

> KEVIN MARSCAPONE?

#### AUTUMN

> YES, KEVIN. OF COURSE KEVIN!

#### MAN

> DON'T YOU HAVE KEYS TO --

#### AUTUMN

> I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR THE DAY; MY KEYS ARE IN MY LOCKER!
> 
> NOW, EMERGENCY OVERRIDE!

#### MAN

> YES, MA'AM!

<BR><I>The stunned man turns to a control panel. He depresses a sequence of buttons as I speed down the hallway, hopeful my disguise's limitations are lost in the chaos.</i>

<i>I am thankfully out of sight of the desk when I hear a door whirr open. I jaunt to the side and step into the doorway and what I see nearly causes me to drop the illusion.</i>

<i>It's Kevin, sitting upon the bed with a desperate expression. The alarms have torn him from rest.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WHAT'S HAPPENED?

<BR><I>My voice falters as I struggle to speak to him from behind the stranger's appearance. It is so good to see him. His empty mouth angers me but I cannot yet drop my face.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION.

#### KEVIN

> TERRORISTS?

#### AUTUMN

> WE DON'T KNOW.
> 
> NOW, COME WITH ME.

#### KEVIN

> I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
> 
> I'M WAITING FOR MY PARENTS.

#### AUTUMN

> BOY!!
> 
> YOUR PARENTS AREN'T COMING!
> 
> NOW GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE YOU ARE INCINERATED!

<BR><I>He seems to be trying to muster any sort of resistance but as he draws his eyes up to mine, his resolve melts into fear. He looks small, there, and helpless.</i>

#### KEVIN

> OKAY.

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>Running. More running. The hallways are filled with choking smoke and faceless people fleeing for safety. I keep looking over my shoulder to ensure that my son is still in tow. I half-expect to see him dragging around a stuffed animal. But he is empty-handed; the days of his childhood are far behind us.</i>

<i>Outside are clusters of chattering people. I have no need of them anymore. I have my son.</i>

<i>Their eyes drift toward us but I continue to lead my son into the trees.</i>

<i>He cries out.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WHERE ARE WE GOING?

#### AUTUMN

> AWAY FROM THE SMOKE!

<BR><I>He continues in my shadow, working his way messily through the undergrowth.</i>

<i>We go on like that until a wolf blocks my path. Instead of looking into the wolf's eyes, I turn backward to my son. He, too, has one of my companions in his path.</i>

#### KEVIN

> STEADY...

<BR><I>He looks toward me without changing his fearful posture. I listen. The sound of frightened humans has disappeared into the forest.</i>

<i>But my heart has not yet steadied enough to grant me the bravery to face him. I melt into the form of a dire wolf.</i>

<i>He stands completely still as I approach, his gaze locked on me in disbelief.</i>

#### KEVIN

> FATHER?

<BR>
