## // OLD GOTH ESTATE // 

<BR><i>Cassandra is sitting alone in her house. She looks at her phone nervously. Once, twice, and then again. </i>

<i>When it finally rings, she jumps.</i>

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE

> HEY, I'M OUTSIDE.

#### CASSANDRA GOTH 

> OK OMW.

<br><i>Her hands are shaking when she leaves her first floor bedroom to attend to the front door. KEVIN is dressed in a suit. His pant-legs are damp and icy.</i>

<i>She blocks the door and doesn't allow him to enter the premise. KEVIN backs away, sensing her tense mood. </i>

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE 

> IT'S NICE TONIGHT, ENJOYING THE AIR.

#### CASSANDRA GOTH  

> (pause) YEAH.

<br><i>KEVIN looks around strangely.</i>

#### CASSANDRA GOTH  

> (with sudden strength) SO. YOU LIED TO ME.

<br><i>KEVIN looks at her and tenses his eyebrows. He is squinting painfully with the reflective snow.</i>

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE 

> I... DIDN'--

#### CASSANDRA GOTH 

> YOU'RE A FUCKING VAMPIRE! YOU FUCKED ME WHEN I WAS SLEEPING, YOU FED ON ME, I DON'T EVEN --

<br><i>KEVIN is alarmed at the accusation but maintains a guilty stance.</i>

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE

> I NEVER FED ON YOU CASSANDRA.

#### CASSANDRA GOTH 

> BULLSHIT~!

<br><i>CASSANDRA begins to tear up and cry.</i>

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE

> I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM. PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.

#### CASSANDRA GOTH 

> (defiant) WHAT, SO YOU CAN CONTINUE THE LIE?

#### KEVIN MARSCAPONE

> I USED TO FEED ON BLOOD, YES, I FELT POWER FLOW THROUGH ME WHEN I CONSUMED THE DREAMS OF OTHERS... BUT I GAVE IT UP. I GAVE IT UP. I AM NO LONGER... THAT WHICH I WAS.

<br><i>CASSANDRA GOTH, violently crying, runs in the house and slams the door.</i>

<BR>
