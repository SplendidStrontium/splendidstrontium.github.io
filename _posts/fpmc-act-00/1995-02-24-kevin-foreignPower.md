### // THE LABORATORY //

<BR><I>This evening, the Doctor has graced me with his presence. We were falling into a pattern, even just twice-repeated, that we would dine over open books. The Doctor did not eat, but he sipped at a glass of brandy while I browsed the texts.</i>

<i>He was polite, if nothing else kind could be said.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> MY HOME WAS A PARADISE, YOU KNOW.
> 
> SO MUCH MORE FREE THAN THIS PLACE YOU FIND YOURSELF IN.
> 
> NONE HAD TO LIVE INSIDE A CAGE.

#### KEVIN

> YOU CAME FROM YEUROP?

<BR><I>The Doctor had a strange quality to his manner of speech which I could not quite place.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING, I SUPPOSE.
> 
> I WAS EDUCATED THERE.
> 
> I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE EVER BEEN.

<BR><I>I hold my tongue in affirmation.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
> 
> OR AT LEAST IT WAS, UNTIL THE MORTALS BEGAN TO REMAKE IT IN THE NEW STYLE.
> 
> IT IS NOT SOMETHING IRREPARABLE BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.
> 
> PERHAPS YOU TOO WILL SEE IT SOME DAY.
> 
> THE TELEVISION CAN'T DO IT JUSTICE.

#### KEVIN

> I WILL SEE IT IN MY OWN TIME.

#### TRELAINE

> OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

<BR><I>I flip through the textbook, the page flipping the only audible ambiance.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> WE'RE GOING TO REMAKE THE WORLD.
> 
> YOU DESERVE TO SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW.

#### KEVIN

> I'LL CHOOSE MY OWN VANTAGE POINT, THANK YOU.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU'RE ANGRY NOW, BUT IT WILL LESSEN WITH TIME.

<BR><I>I did not like his overarching, commanding way of condescending to me.</i>

<i>I did not like being told what I would and wouldn't feel.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I DOUBT MY ANGER WILL DISSIPATE UNTIL YOU ALLOW ME THE CHANCE TO RETURN HOME.

<BR><I>But the Doctor Trelaine refuses my defiance.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> GREAT CHANGE ACCOMPANIES GREAT CHANGE, KEVIN.
> 
> YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TODAY BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.
> 
> THAT IS WHY WE LIBERATED YOU FROM YOUR PRISON.
> 
> SO THAT YOU COULD THINK CLEARLY.

#### KEVIN

> I THINK PLENTY CLEARLY.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU THINK THAT.
> 
> IT FEELS THAT WAY TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN INDOCTRINATED TO THEIR CORRUPTED WAY OF LIFE.
> 
> A WAY OF LIFE THAT SEES THEM LOCK THEIR ONLY SON IN A CAGE.
> 
> GROW UP WITHIN ITS WALLS AND LIMITATIONS.
> 
> YOU DESERVE BETTER.

#### KEVIN

> THEN SET ME FREE.

<BR><I>I try to fully portray the depth of my contempt.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THAT.
> 
> THE WORLD NEEDS YOU.
> 
> I NEED YOU.

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T SERVE THE WORLD.

#### TRELAINE

> AND INSTEAD YOU'D PREFER THE WORLD SERVE YOU?

<BR><I>He laughs, a cold, high, mirthless laugh.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> WE CAN DO THAT TOO, KEVIN.
> 
> YOU HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL WE NEED ONLY UNLOCK.
> 
> SURELY YOUR FATHER HAS RECOGNIZED IT.

#### KEVIN

> AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF MY FATHER?

#### TRELAINE

> SURELY I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE THAN YOU'VE LEARNED YOURSELF.
> 
> THOUGH I DOUBT YOUR OLD MAN IS VERY TALKATIVE, HMM?

<BR><I>I did not say anything.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> YOUR FATHER IS FROM A VERY SPECIAL PLANE.
> 
> VERY SPECIAL INDEED.
> 
> IT EXISTS ORTHOGONAL TO OUR OWN.
> 
> MY PEOPLE CALL IT ELYSION.
> 
> WHAT DO YOUR PEOPLE CALL IT?

<BR><I>I found myself rather dumbstruck and unable to conjure a response.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> HAS HE NOT TOLD YOU HIMSELF?
> 
> WHAT A PITY.
> 
> HAS HE ALSO NOT TOLD YOU THAT THE ONLY REASON HE IS HERE IS TO SERVE PENANCE FOR PAST SINS?
> 
> DOESN'T YOUR FATHER EVER TALK TO YOU?

<BR><I>I felt the heat of embarrassment rise to my cheeks.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MY FATHER TALKS TO ME PLENTY.

#### TRELAINE

> AND YET IT SEEMS HE'S TOLD YOU SO LITTLE OF HIS TRUE NATURE.

#### KEVIN

> I AM SURE HE WAS TO TELL ME IN TIME.

#### TRELAINE

> AND WHY NOT FROM DAY ONE?
> 
> WHY HAS HE HIDDEN HIMSELF FROM HIS ONLY SON?

#### KEVIN

> MY FATHER IS SICKLY. HE DOES THINGS WHEN HE'S ABLE TO DO THEM.

#### TRELAINE

> THE LORD OF HELL IS NEVER TRULY SICK.

<BR>
