### // THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<br><i>I never entered the home when the Orphans were awake. The sound of the heavy doors would have begat too many questions. The house was still made of ordinary stone and ordinary plaster and the noise would have easily rippled through to curious ears.</i>

<i>When I pass through the lower entrance, I immediately hear my wife descending to bid me welcome.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> VINCENT. 
> 
> THE HOME HAS MISSED YOU.

#### VINCENT

> AND I, IT.

<br><i>The smell of travels reminds me of years long gone past.</i>

<i>It is good to see her again.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> HOW FARED YOUR TRAVELS?

#### VINCENT

> WELL.
> 
> I BEGGED THE WOLVES FOR AID.

#### MYRTLE

> THE WOLVES?
> 
> BUT YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR...

#### VINCENT

> YES, I KNOW.
> 
> BUT THE CRIME IS EGREGIOUS. HE IS OUR SON.
> 
> THIS THEFT CANNOT GO UNPUNISHED.

#### MYRTLE

> I WISH THERE WERE SOMETHING I COULD DO.

#### VINCENT

> YOU DO SOMETHING BY CONTINUING TO GUARD OUR OTHER CHILDREN.
> 
> IF THE WORLD IS TO BE THIS TREACHEROUS THEN WE MUST PROTECT THEM.
> 
> THE WORLD WON'T BE SAFE FOR ANY MAGIC-USER, LEAST OF ALL THOSE THAT DON'T DWELL IN THE SAFETY OF AN OLD FAMILY.

#### MYRTLE

> I HAD FEARED AS MUCH.

<BR><I>I reach forward and hug her.</i>

#### VINCENT

> I'LL GET HIM BACK.
> 
> I PROMISE.

#### MYRTLE

> IT WILL BE GOOD TO HAVE HIM BACK.
> 
> I CAN'T BELIEVE THE WOLVES WERE WILLING TO HELP YOU.
> 
> THAT IS A BOON.

<br><i>I stand straight to get a view of her eyes in my own.</i>

#### VINCENT

> I KNOW YOU HAVE A HISTORY.

<BR><I>She pulls back, embarrassed.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> IT IS NOT IMPORTANT. 
> 
> WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE A PLANESWANDERER ON OUR SIDE.
> 
> THAT IS WHAT WE NEED.

#### VINCENT

> I THOUGHT SO.
> 
> I DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO GO LIGHTLY.

#### MYRTLE

> YOU WILL GO BACK TO THEM AND THEY WILL REPORT TO YOU IF THEY'VE FOUND ANYTHING?

#### VINCENT

> THAT IS MY PLAN.

#### MYRTLE

> I AM GLAD FOR YOU.
> 
> GLAD FOR US.

#### VINCENT

> THE JOURNEY WAS TAXING.

#### MYRTLE

> DO YOU NEED...?

#### VINCENT

> I'LL MANAGE.

<BR><I>My eyes are watery and emotional.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE A TRADE?

<BR><I>The denizens of the Wild rarely gave anything for nothing. Even a deal amongst allies could be written up in detailed contracts. But the wolves had asked for nothing. They had wanted to help find my son.</i>

#### VINCENT

> I GAVE NOTHING, I TOOK NOTHING. 
> 
> I SPOKE ONLY OF OUR CURRENT PLIGHT.

#### MYRTLE

> SUCH A HELPFUL FACE THEY'VE WORN.
> 
> THE MORTALS HAVE A SAYING.

#### VINCENT

> I'VE HEARD ENOUGH OF THEIR IDIOMS TO LAST ME A LIFETIME.
> 
> MAKE YOUR POINT SUCCINCTLY.

#### MYRTLE

> NOTHING IS FREE.

#### VINCENT

> YOUR SUSPICION IS PALPABLE.
> 
> ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE SEEMS OBSCURED.

<BR><I>She turns away while wringing her hands, her voice now muffled as she throws it to the wall.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION ANY WORSE THAN WHAT WE'RE ALREADY IN.

<BR><I>I walk toward her and place a hand on each of her shoulders, trying to offer my support.</i>

#### VINCENT

> THEY ARE SCOUTS, NOT MERCENARIES.
> 
> THEY ARE MY FRIENDS.

#### MYRTLE

> AND WHAT STOPS THEM FROM ATTEMPTING TO GET REVENGE FOR YEARS OF NEGLECT?

#### VINCENT

> THEY CANNOT COME HERE.
> 
> THE CITYSCAPE IS TOO DENSE. THEY DON'T DARE.

<BR><I>She curls her arms up to wrap herself in her hands as I hold her.</i>

#### VINCENT

> AND I DON'T THINK THEY HARBOR A GRUDGE.

#### MYRTLE

> I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

#### VINCENT

> THEY DID NOT SEEM...TOO ANGRY AT ME.
> 
> AT US.
> 
> THEY FEEL THE PASSAGE OF TIME AS ACUTELY AS WE DO.

#### MYRTLE

> THEY'VE LET BYGONES BE BYGONES?

#### VINCENT

> UGH. MORE OF YOUR RIDICULOUS TURNS OF PHRASE.

<BR><I>She whips herself around to face me.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE FOR ME TO APOLOGIZE AND YOU KNOW IT.
> 
> THEY WILL WELCOME YOU AS AN OLD FRIEND BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE THE ENEMY.

#### VINCENT

> YOU ARE NOT OUR ENEMY.
> 
> KEVIN'S CAPTORS ARE OUR ENEMY.

#### MYRTLE

> AND WHEN WE FIND HIM AND THE WOLVES WANT TO BRING YOU ALONG ON SOME FOOLISH ERRAND, WHAT THEN?
> 
> WHERE WILL THE SCHOOL BE THEN?

<BR><I>I was losing my patience. I had expected, rather, I had wanted her congratulations. And I was receiving anything but.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

<BR><I>Her face remains impassive, yet defiant.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WE HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO CARE FOR THE BOY. THIRTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER HIM.
> 
> WE MUST SEE HIM RETURN TO US.
> 
> WHO ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE REACHED OUT TO?
> 
> THE COVEN?

<BR><I>She purses her lips, drawing them close into a grimace.</i>

#### VINCENT

> YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH BILLS YOU CANNOT PAY AND YET YOU CONSIDER THE COVEN?
> 
> I AM SURE THEY WOULD HAVE GLADLY LENT THEIR AID.
> 
> PRICE TO BE DISCUSSED AT A LATER DATE.
> 
> I DO NOT KEEP FRIENDS THAT KEEP SUCH DETAILED NOTES IN THEIR CHECKBOOKS.

<BR><I>I knew she would be reticent to discuss the Coven. I had not wanted to tread upon this area of disharmony between us and knew not how to escape.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I'LL BE THE FIRST TO REPORT ON THEIR UNORTHODOX METHODS...

#### VINCENT

> "UNORTHODOX METHODS"?!
> 
> DARE I REMIND YOU --

<BR><I>She holds up her hands in surrender.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> NO, PLEASE.
> 
> THOSE YEARS ARE LONG PAST.

#### VINCENT

> SO LET THEM REMAIN LONG PAST.
> 
> THE WOLVES DO NOT FATHOM THE KIND OF DISCOURSE THE WITCHES FIND POLITE AND COMMONPLACE.

#### MYRTLE

> MAYBE WE COULD GO AT IT OURSELVES.

#### VINCENT

> HE COULD BE ANYWHERE IN THE TRI-STATE AREA BY NOW.
> 
> FURTHER, EVEN.

#### MYRTLE

> I COULD ATTEMPT ANOTHER SCRY.

#### VINCENT

> I AM NOT OPPOSED, BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WILL SOLVE OUR PROBLEM.
> 
> I DO NOT HAVE THE SENSITIVITY TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
> 
> NOT TODAY. NOT ANYMORE.

<BR><I>It was a reality I did not want to face, but had no choice. I knew exactly how weak I was in this time, this place.</i>

#### VINCENT

> FOR NOW, WE WILL WAIT.
> 
> WE WILL WAIT.

<BR>
