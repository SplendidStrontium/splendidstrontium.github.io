*****
<br/><i>Yesterday evening had been a strange evening. The late morning had seen AVAELLE EASTON, DOCTOR LENARD McCOY go out of doors to groom their horses. Soon after they went inside to [prepare for lunch]({% post_url /fpmc-act-00/1839-10-20-avaelleeaston-2 %}), THE DOCTOR cited a need for an afternoon nap and retreated to the guest room. AVAELLE spent the rest of the day by herself, spending some time in front of her Bible during a quiet time in the afternoon.</i>

<i>The sun begins to wane and AVAELLE sees MAURICE for a small supper. Her father is still abed. AVAELLE is about to retire to her bedroom for the evening when she encounters THE DOCTOR in the upstairs hallway. She has a candle in hand, intending to light the hallway.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> DID YOU ENJOY YOUR WALK?

<br/><I>AVAELLE's tone is lightly caustic. She had found herself desirous of his company after he'd spent the afternoon in seclusion.</i>

#### McCOY ####

> DID YOU TRY TO COME FETCH ME FOR SUPPER?
>
> I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, MISS. I MUST HAVE MISSED YOU.
>
> YES, I WENT OUT FOR A WALK AROUND YOUR FIELDS.

#### AVAELLE ####

> I'M SURE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO SEE.

#### McCOY ####

> IT IS A LOVELY HOME. 

#### AVAELLE ####

> WE MISSED YOU AT SUPPER.

#### McCOY ####

> DID MAURICE MAKE IT DOWN?

#### AVAELLE ####

> YES, HE DID.
>
> I'M GLAD TO SEE HE'S IMPROVING.

#### McCOY ####

> YES, I AM TOO.

<br/><i>A pause hangs in the air for a moment. AVAELLE refuses eye contact with THE DOCTOR as she walks down the hallway sharing her flame with the candles.</i>

#### McCOY ####

> WOULD YOU LET ME SIT FOR MY PORTRAIT THIS EVENING?

<br/><I>AVAELLE turns toward him, catching his eye.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> IT'S A LITTLE LATE, DON'T YOU THINK?

#### McCOY ####

> WERE YOU GOING TO RETIRE?

#### AVAELLE ####

> I WAS GOING TO.

#### McCOY ####

> I DON'T INTEND TO KEEP YOU LONG.

#### AVAELLE ####

> THE LIGHTING IS POOR.

#### McCOY ####

> PERHAPS THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE.
>
> I DO SO LIKE THE DARKER PORTRAITS.
>
> SOMETHING SET TO CANDLELIGHT.
>
> I'M SOMETHING OF A NIGHT-OWL, MYSELF.

#### AVAELLE ####

> MY FATHER, WHEN HE'S WELL, PREFERS TO WORK IN THE EARLY MORNING.
>
> I SUPPOSE I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO IT.

<BR/><I>She abruptly blows out the candle in her hand.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> IF YOU INSIST.

<BR/>

*****
<BR/><BR/><I>AVAELLE, THE DOCTOR, continue downstairs and enter the sitting area. It is untidy with easels and sketch-paper. She lights some candles located on the mismatched tables around the room.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> I HOPE YOU'LL EXCUSE THE MESS.
>
> WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO CLEAN.
>
> PLEASE, FIND YOURSELF A PLACE TO RELAX. I'LL RETURN IN A MOMENT.

<BR/><I>She leaves the room and enters the kitchen. MAURICE is nursing the fire.</i>

<i>AVAELLE is sure that THE DOCTOR can hear their words.</i>

#### MAURICE ####

> STAYING UP LATE, MISS?

<BR/><I>A log falls upon the fire and hisses, steam rushing out as it ignites.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> YES, TONIGHT I'M SKETCHING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE DOCTOR'S PORTRAIT.

<BR/><I>There's nothing much to be shared in the twilight.</i>

#### MAURICE ####

> ... IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GET FOR YOU, MISS?

#### AVAELLE ####

> JUST... TAKE A BIT OF PIE UP FOR MY FATHER.
>
> IF YOU DON'T MIND.
>
> ARE YOU GOING TO BED?

#### MAURICE ####

> OH, YES. I'M STILL NOT FEELING WELL.
>
> I'M GOING TO READ AND SLEEP SOON AFTER.
>
> I CAN TAKE UP SOMETHING FOR YOUR FATHER.

<BR/><I>AVAELLE bends down and warms her hands at the fire.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> THANK YOU, MAURICE.

<BR/><I>When AVAELLE again re-emerges into the sitting room, she has a small cup of whisky in hand.</i>

<i>THE DOCTOR is tending the fire. He can smell the sweet stench of the alcohol from where he is standing.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

#### McCOY ####

> WHISKY? OH NO, THAT'S QUITE ALRIGHT.
>
> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>
> IT MAKES ME A LITTLE SLEEPY AND I'D PREFER NOT TO FALL ASLEEP THIS EVENING.

#### AVAELLE ####

> I UNDERSTAND. 
>
> I JUST NEED A LITTLE.

<BR/>

*****
<BR/><I>The pair settle in and get used to the quiet of the evening shadow. THE DOCTOR sits in a chair and AVAELLE sits across from him, taking a large sketchpad and charcoals in hand. The squeaking of the house's frame has subsided and only the two of them remain awake as the evening continues to lengthen.</i>

<i>AVAELLE scratches against the paper in wide, careful strokes, trying to capture THE DOCTOR's serious, contemplative expression. She spends a good deal of time on his hair, combed straight over his skull, and his eyes, inset, and yet, with an alert brightness against the candlelight.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> YOU WANT TO SEND THIS TO YOUR MOTHER?

#### McCOY ####

> PERHAPS. SHE WAS ALWAYS ONE FOR GIFTS.

#### AVAELLE ####

> WHAT IS SHE LIKE?

#### McCOY ####

> MY MOTHER?
>
> SHE KEEPS BUSY TENDING AFTER MY YOUNGER SISTERS.
>
> SHE'S STRONG, STOUT.

#### AVAELLE ####

> THEN YOU MUST BE LIKE YOUR FATHER.

<BR/><I>THE DOCTOR chuckles.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> OH, NO -- I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!
>
> JUST...

#### McCOY ####

> AH, WELL. IT'S TRUE THAT I'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS.
>
> I OFTEN SUFFER FROM BOUTS OF INDIGESTION.
>
> I'M SORRY I HAVE NOT BE ABLE TO PARTAKE OF YOUR FINE COOKING.

<BR/><I>AVAELLE tries to hide her disappointment.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> I'M NOT THAT GIFTED.
>
> MAURICE IS BETTER THAN I.
>
> I AM OFTEN TASKED WITH MINCING.

#### McCOY ####

> I HAVE SAMPLED YOUR OFFERINGS BY SCENT.
>
> YOU DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT.

#### AVAELLE ####

> I...
>
> I APPRECIATE THAT.

#### McCOY ####

> MY MOTHER RARELY APPLIES HERSELF TO THE KITCHEN.
>
> IT IS BECOMING LESS AND LESS ESSENTIAL.

<BR/><I>AVAELLE continues to sketch, the sound filling the silent space.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON LEAVING?

#### McCOY ####

> I HAVE SENT FOR ANOTHER DOCTOR TO COME TO THE TOWN.
>
> I DO NOT KNOW WHEN HE WILL ARRIVE, BUT AFTERWARD, I INTEND TO GO TRAVELLING.
>
> I AM NOT WELL-SUITED TO STAY IN ONE PLACE.

#### AVAELLE ####

> YOU'RE LEAVING THE VILLAGE?

#### McCOY ####

> NOT FOR SOME TIME, YET.

#### AVAELLE ####

> YOU'LL NEED TO COME BACK TO SIT FOR YOUR PORTRAIT.

#### McCOY ####

> I'M SURE THAT MY REPLACEMENT WILL NOT BE HERE THIS WEEK OR THE NEXT.
>
> OR PERHAPS EVEN THE NEXT, AS THINGS GO.
>
> NO, I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO FINISH OUR WORK.

<BR/><I>AVAELLE blushes at the use of the inclusive word.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> I SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE ROOM CLEAN.

<BR/><I>She thinks on the ruined paintbrushes.</i>

#### AVAELLE ####

> FATHER WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED.

#### McCOY ####

> YOU'VE BEEN BUSY KEEPING THE HOUSE INTACT.
>
> IT'S NOT SOMETHING ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO DO FOR ONESELF.

#### AVAELLE ####

> MAURICE SHOULD BE WELL TOMORROW.

#### McCOY ####

> AND YOUR FATHER, TOO.
>
> I SPOKE TO HIM THIS AFTERNOON. HE IS CERTAINLY ON THE MEND.
>
> YOU'LL HAVE YOUR COMPANY SOON.

#### AVAELLE ####

> I'M GLAD FOR IT.
>
> WHERE WILL YOU GO?

#### McCOY ####

> I WILL GO WEST.
>
> I AM SURE THERE IS ROOM FOR A STRANGE MAN SUCH AS MYSELF.
