### // BELLEVUE HOSPITAL //

<br><i>In a hospital bed on the East Side of New York City lays a woman heavily wrapped in bandages. The night has taken hold over the city and a bright moon casts long shadows that leak in through the windows.</i>

<i>The woman's name is AVAELLE EASTON. She's received no visitors.</i>

<i>A week prior she arrived at the hospital after suffering severe burns during a fire at her boarding house. Her face, hands, and legs were burned while she tried to escape the blaze that ravaged her residence. At first ecstatic that she'd survived such a near-death experience, the cold nights at the hospital have been slow and quiet and despair has begun to fill her, fearful that she'll never be able to regain her normal life.</i>

<i>She lays on the bed, largely immobile due to her dressings. The wind rattles the window. The small room is gripped in the quiet of night.</i>

<i>AVAELLE stares at the white painted window, focused on the untidy covering that's left some paint on the glass pane. Her mind is otherwise too active to sleep, intensely preoccupied with the uncertainty of her future outside of the hospital.</i>

<i>Her father's been dead several years and she hasn't heard from MAURICE for near on a year; she'd sold EASTON HOUSE and let MAURICE go after his own affairs. They'd kept up a while but he'd eventually written that he'd found work. She didn't want him to know what had happened and where she was. Doubt lingered in her mind that she'd be able to continue her livelihood if her face and hands were permanently scarred. </i>

<i>So much for getting married.</i>

<i>Down the hallway, a woman suddenly wails loudly. AVAELLE listens intently, filling her mind with the weeping, knowing she has no such leisure. Her face was in far too much pain to scrunch it up with tears -- she'd already tried.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>Her eyes are shut when the door opens. She is still facing the window and can see nothing of the visitor. Her eyes flutter open to see the window blue with night sky.</i>

<i>Her voice is raspy and fatigued from disuse.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> EVENING, DOCTOR.

<BR><I>No reply comes.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> ...NURSE?

<BR><I>Still silence.</i>

<i>She had become accustomed to the bustling about of hospital staff during the daytime hours, but it was unusual that she'd be visited at this late hour.</i>

<i>Her only thought was that it was someone to tend the embers in the fireplace but then why hadn't the individual spoken to her, if only to give her fears quiet?</i>

<i>The steps stop beside her bed.</i>

<i>Her heart sinks in fear. Was someone here to do her harm?</i>

#### AVAELLE

> HELLO?

<BR><I>She is left in stunned stillness when a voice she recognizes breaks the mystery.</i>

#### McCOY

> YOU LOOK AWFUL.

<BR><I>How many years has it been?!</i>

#### AVAELLE

> DOCTOR?!

<BR><I>She considers attempting to turn her head to see him but the tightness that's drawn her skin together makes it impossible.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> DOCTOR, I...

#### McCOY

> YOU NEVER WROTE.

<BR><I>It was true she'd always meant to...</i>

#### McCOY

> I ASSUME YOU RECEIVED WHAT I SENT?

<br><i>His voice is curt and accusatory.</i>

#### AVAELLE

> THAT SPRING...

#### McCOY

> THAT SPRING YOU RECEIVED CORRESPONDENCE FROM ME.
> 
> BUT I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING --
> 
> NOT A WORD -- 
> 
> IN RETURN.

<BR><I>It was true.</i>

#### McCOY 

> WHY?

<BR><I>His reproachful tone hurts her. Her bandages make her feel a prisoner.</i>

#### McCOY

> WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO ME?

<BR><I>And though she tries to resist it, her eyes begin to well up with tears. Her face twists in pain and she tries to stifle the expression best she can.</i>

#### McCOY

> WHY?

#### AVAELLE

> BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID!

#### McCOY

> WHAT DID YOU FEAR?
> 
> YOU APPARENTLY DID NOT FEAR LEAVING YOUR LITTLE FARM, FOR HERE YOU ARE.
> 
> AND YOUR FATHER DIED ALONE.
> 
> TUT-TUT.

#### AVAELLE

> DOCTOR, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND --

<BR><I>She breaks off her own speech, leaving a gap between the two.</i>

#### McCOY

> MY NAME IS LENARD.

#### AVAELLE

> LENARD...

<BR><I>He walks around the edge of the bed and approaches the side where her head is laid. He kneels down and they finally catch each other's eyes in the moonglow.</i>

#### McCOY

> WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?

<BR><I>Her eyes are still brimming with salt water. It stings as it wets the bandages.</i>

#### McCOY

> YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BALL LOOKING LIKE THAT.

<BR><I>He stands up and begins to run his hands over her silhouette, distanced, as if warming his hands over hot coals.</i>

<i>A tingling sensation echoes over her skin. It is pleasant at first, as the pain dissipates. But the
