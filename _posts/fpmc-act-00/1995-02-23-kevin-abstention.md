*****
### // THE LABORATORY //

<br><i>I pass the day in my cell trying to glance at the clock only intermittently. It will only display at the press of a button, but it is good practice to try to avoid obsessively staring at, and trusting, those red letters.</i>

<i>The television is my only companion in that place. My eyes are glued to its glow to the exclusion of the impassive steel walls.</i>

<i>The Doctor Trelaine did not join me for dinner that night. His assistant, Nurse Autumn, came to my cell when dinner was dispatched.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> I'M SORRY THE DOCTOR WON'T BE ABLE TO JOIN YOU FOR DINNER TONIGHT. 
> 
> HE'S CAUGHT UP WITH A MEETING.

<BR><i>At least there's something more pressing than impressing upon my solitude.</i>

<i>I dared to make the picture box my only confidante.</i>

#### KEVIN

> CAN I GO TO THE LIBRARY?

#### AUTUMN

> YES, YOU MAY.
> 
> I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

<BR><I>The walk down the hallway is wordless.</i>

#### AUTUMN

> YOU MAY STAY FOR AN HOUR.

<BR><I>She leaves, pursing her lips as the hydraulic door whirrs shut.</i>
