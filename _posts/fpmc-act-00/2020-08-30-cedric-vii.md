CEDRIC's eyes fly open. His foray into Elysion -- the Dream -- has concluded. He  just barely loses his sense of self while he travels; a brief respite from the endless chains of reality. Since accepting the Gift, true sleep as the Mortals experience has been unknown to him.

A flip, a few button presses, and the alarm is silenced. He grimaces, if only slightly. The time is 6:30 AM.
