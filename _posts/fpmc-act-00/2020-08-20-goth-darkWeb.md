<br><i>CASSANDRA GOTH, 24, sits alone in a large house in STEINWAY. She puts down a hairbrush and emits a heavy sigh. She pulls out from a desk drawer her cell phone, a large, dated device. </i>

<i>She scrolls through a short list of contacts to find 'Alex', her younger brother. His contact photo shows a young boy with an uncertain smile. He is about fifteen years old. </i>

#### CASSANDRA

> (after two rings) HEY ALEX. HOW'S IT GOING?

<i>There is a pause before Alex responds. Something is caught in the silence between them.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> OKAY. (pause) YOU?

#### CASSANDRA 

> I'M OKAY. WORK IS KEEPING ME BUSY. NEW JOB IS ... SOMETHIN'.

#### ALEXANDER

> YEAH I HAVE A PROJECT DUE MONDAY TOO. I GOTTA BUILD A CASTLE OR SOMETHING.

<br><i>CASSANDRA is silent for a moment. But ALEXANDER, too, seems to want to dwell in the quiet. It is just peaceful for the siblings to hear each other on the phone.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> HOW IS DAD DOING?

<br><i>ALEX doesn't respond.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> ALEX?

#### ALEXANDER 

> WAS MOM HAVING AN AFFAIR?

#### CASSANDRA

> (shocked) WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT, ALEX?

#### ALEXANDER 

> JUST 'CAUSE ... DAD...

#### CASSANDRA

> ALEX, CAN I COME PICK YOU UP?

#### ALEXANDER 

> YEAH... SURE.

<br><i>CASSANDRA leaves her room and exits through an untidy conservatory. A number of plants lay abandoned in their planters. She locks the door and gets into a sporty red convertible.</i>

<i>When she reaches the GOTH MANOR, it seems as if she's been driving for some time. Her loose hair, secured in a simple ponytail at the back of her neck, is untidy from the wind. ALEXANDER is sitting on the sheltered front stoop, writing in a black&white composition notebook. He hears the car arrive and closes the notebook. He joins her in the car without greeting. </i>

<i>CASSANDRA is about to drive off when her father, MORTIMER, runs out of the house carrying a golden URN.</i>

#### MORTIMER 

> CASSY~!

#### CASSANDRA

> (with pause) HI, DAD. 

<br><i>MORTIMER walks up to the car. ALEX is fiddling with his seatbelt, and seeming to take as long as possible to avoid his father's gaze.</i>

#### MORTIMER 

> CASSY, CAN YOU TAKE YOUR MOTHER TO THE CONSERVATORY? I THINK SHE'D LIKE --

#### CASSANDRA 

> (interrupting) YEAH DAD, NO PROBLEM.

<br><i>CASSANDRA reaches under her dash and pops the trunk. MORTIMER places the URN in the net affixed to the inside of the trunk. He uses a few bungie cords to attach the urn. When he's finished, he comes around to the side of the car to talk to his children. The car idles noisily.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE ALEX FOR A DRIVE. HE'LL BE BACK BY EIGHT. 

#### MORTIMER

> THAT'S FINE. (to ALEX) YOU FINISHED YOUR HOMEWORK?

#### ALEXANDER 

> (looking at the sideview mirror) YEAH DAD. I JUST HAVE MY PROJECT LEFT.

#### MORTIMER 

> DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME LEFT TO FINISH --

#### ALEXANDER 

> (interrupting) YEAH DAD, DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE HOME AT EIGHT. 

#### CASSANDRA

> SEE YA, DAD. I'LL MAKE SURE MOM GETS WHERE SHE'S GOING.

<br><i>MORTIMER awkwardly waves as his children drive off. CASSANDRA, ALEX sit in silence for a while; ALEX stares intently out the right side of the car. The young boy maintains his gaze while breaking the silence.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> SO HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB?

#### CASSANDRA

> (pause) IT'S OKAY. (pause) I THINK OUR RECEPTIONIST HAS A CRUSH ON ME.

<br><i>ALEXANDER refuses to answer. Her attempt at humor falls on a cold shoulder.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> BUT --

#### ALEXANDER 

> I THOUGHT YOU WERE DATING THAT GUY KEVIN.

#### CASSANDRA

> KEVIN?! (strangled cough) HEH, NO, WE'RE NOT --

#### ALEXANDER 

> YOU DO KNOW HE'S A VAMPIRE, RIGHT?

<br><i>A thick silence falls over the car. CASSANDRA's attention drifts as a driver rudely cuts her off.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> I READ ABOUT HIM ON THE --

#### CASSANDRA

> (fiercely) ALEX, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

<br><i>The two are embarrassed. CASSANDRA is blushing.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> (pause) AND WE'RE NOT DATING.

<br><i>Silence.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> HE'S MY NEIGHBOR AND HE'S HELPED ME DEAL WITH THAT CREEPY ASS HOUSE, OKAY? I'M SORRY ABOUT WEDNESDAY --

<br><i>Silence.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> YOU ... (pause) READ SOMETHING ABOUT ...

#### ALEXANDER 

> I READ ABOUT HIM ON THE WINTRA-NET.

#### CASSANDRA

> WHAT? WHAT DID YOU READ?

#### ALEXANDER 

> HE'S FAMOUS, CASSIE. HE'S A VAMPIRE THAT KILLS VAMPIRES.

#### CASSANDRA

> OKAY ENOUGH OF THE VAMPIRE SHIT.

#### ALEXANDER 

> (defiant) I'M FUCKING SERIOUS!

#### CASSANDRA

> VAMPIRES AREN'T --

#### ALEXANDER 

> YES THEY ARE!

<br><i>Traffic on the road is heavy, keeping CASSANDRA occupied. But ALEXANDER has turned to face his sister. </i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> THEY'RE REAL, I'VE SEEN THEM. I'VE READ ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE FUCKING REAL. LIKE REALLY --

#### CASSANDRA 

> (interrupting) CAN YOU PLEASE STOP WITH THE 'F' BOMBS?

#### ALEXANDER 

> CAN YOU PLEASE STOP BEING LIKE DAD?

<br><i>CASSANDRA grimaces. She cuts off someone in traffic and produces a rude hand gesture.</i>

#### CASSANDRA 

> (after a moment) WHAT ARE YOU READING, WHERE ARE YOU READING?

#### ALEXANDER 

> NOT FUCKING RED--

#### CASSANDRA 

> OKAY OKAY ENOUGH ALEX! GEEZ! I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME RIGHT NOW!

<br><i>A regretful silence. CASSANDRA seems uncommitted to disciplining her brother over cursing.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> SOME FORUMS. I LOOKED HIM UP AFTER WE PLAYED RACING ON WEDNESDAY. HE'S A VAMPIRE VAMPIRE HUNTER.

#### CASSANDRA 

> WHAT THE FUCK ALEX WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

#### ALEXANDER 

> I'M NOT DOING SHIT, IT'S FUCKING TRUE.

#### CASSANDRA 

> ALEX YOU CAN'T TRUST EVERYTHING YOU READ --

#### ALEXANDER 

> ON THE COMPUTER. YEAH. THANKS DAD.

<br><i>CASSANDRA is struggling to hold back her anger. She brakes suddenly and glares to the passenger seat.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> I CHECKED MULTIPLE SOURCES. HE'S FAMOUS. 

<br><i>In a moment, her attention is back to the road. Another light and she quickly begins chewing gum she pulls from her cupholder.</i>

#### ALEXANDER 

> ANYWAY -- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO THOUGHT MOM WAS A WITCH.

#### CASSANDRA 

> I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU NEVER BRING THAT UP AGAIN.
