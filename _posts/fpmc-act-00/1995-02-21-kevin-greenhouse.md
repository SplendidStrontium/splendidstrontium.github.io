### // THE MAGICADEMY //

<BR><I>By the age of twelve, there were a few things I'd learned about myself.</i>

<i>The first was that I was a monster. I had mismatched teeth set askew in my skull. They stuck out this way and that and they did not look like my mother's teeth nor did they look like my father's teeth.</i>

<i>My mother was a stern woman, as beautiful as she was severe. She delighted in games of control and punishment. Perhaps that is why she became Headmistress to the Orphans.</i>

<i>I did not see my father much growing up. But I did not ask questions. I followed the myriad of rules set forth for me by my mother. She was, in every way, another convincing portion of my monster theory. She contained me, kept me within the four walls of the house.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> THEY WILL FEAR YOU, SON.
> 
> YOU MAY NEVER WALK AMONG THEM.

<br><i>But I was all-fearing like the weakest of children, and I took her word for it. I did not fight her, I did not insist that I needed to see the sunlight or play in mud puddles. She said that I could not go and so I did not go and that was the end of that.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> THE SUNLIGHT WILL BURN YOU, SEAR YOUR FLESH IRREVOCABLY.
> 
> YOU'LL BEAR A TERRIBLE SCAR.

<BR><I>And I believed her.</i>

<i>Elsewise I was afforded ultimate freedom -- so long as was the written word bound between leather. I wandered wherever my heart wanted and I knew no schedule. I let the sun rise and set without contest, taking only the student's din to mark the hours. I was shielded from much but it allowed me to focus myself entirely upon my studies. </i>

<i>And study, I did.</i>

<i>It is entirely normal for spellcasters to possess magical bookshelves, in which hundreds even thousands of tomes may be stored away safely without worry of physical space or dust collection. My mother had one such collection. Never did my mother let me place my hand into that portal but she did on my behalf. Should there be anything I wanted, I need only ask.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> IT'LL BENEFIT YOU, TO BE WELL-READ, WHEN YOU NEED TO HELP YOUR FATHER.
> 
> HE KNOWS THESE BOOKS INSIDE AND OUT.

<BR><I>Of course, she was implicitly saying that she did not.</i>

<i>She spent her days with the other children.</i>

<i>The other children were the other reason I believed that I was a monster.</i>

<i>They had no love for me.</i>
