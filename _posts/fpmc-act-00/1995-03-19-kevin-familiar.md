### // MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<BR><I>The days after my father fetched me from Trelaine's prison passed quickly and merrily. I had been holding out hope for a rescue but I had been slipping. But my lack of faith had not been punished.</i>

<i>I was home.</i>

#### KEVIN

> FATHER, THAT WAS REALLY YOU, WASN'T IT?

<BR><I>Our old habits had resumed: Mother put the orphans to bed and Father came to visit me before I retired to bed.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WHY DO YOU THINK I LEFT YOU THE MONSTER MANUAL?

#### KEVIN

> MOTHER NEVER LIKED THAT ONE.

#### VINCENT

> DO NOT FAULT HER.
> 
> SHE HAS SEEN MUCH IN HER TIME. 
> 
> SHE HAS A DISTASTE FOR INTERPRETATIONS. SEES IT AS ANOTHER FORM OF FICTION.

#### KEVIN

> I THOUGHT THE MANUAL WAS TRUE.

#### VINCENT

> IT'S NOT NOT TRUE.
> 
> EVERYTHING EXISTS SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW.

#### KEVIN

> FATHER.
> 
> I HAVE A QUESTION.

#### VINCENT

> GO AHEAD.

#### KEVIN

> TRELAINE SAID YOU WERE A KING.
> 
> IS THAT TRUE?

#### VINCENT

> SURELY HE MUST BE MISTAKEN.
> 
> I WAS NEVER A KING.
> 
> THOUGH I WAS A PRINCE, A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

#### KEVIN

> YOU WERE A PRINCE?
> 
> WHY "WERE"?

#### VINCENT

> I ALLOWED SOME OF MY WORST NIGHTMARES TO BE STOLEN BY THOSE WHO'D SEEK TO MISUSE THEM.
> 
> I WAS CARELESS.
> 
> I WAS NOT THE LEADER MY PEOPLE DESERVED.

#### KEVIN

> YOU MADE A MISTAKE?

#### VINCENT

> YES, I DID.
> 
> ADULTS MAKE MISTAKES, JUST AS I MADE A MISTAKE BY NOT PROTECTING YOU.

#### KEVIN

> YOU WERE RESTING.
> 
> IT'S OKAY.

#### VINCENT

> NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.
> 
> IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE CERTAIN...LIMITATIONS.
> 
> BUT I SHOULD NEVER LET ANYTHING STAND BETWEEN ME AND MY DUTY TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.
> 
> TO OUR WHOLE FAMILY.

#### KEVIN

> I'M JUST GLAD TO BE HOME.

#### VINCENT

> AND WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HOME.
> 
> THE PLACE WAS EMPTY WITHOUT YOU.

#### KEVIN

> WILL MY TEETH GROW BACK?

#### VINCENT

> I THINK SO.

#### KEVIN

> DID YOU HAVE TEETH LIKE MINE?

#### VINCENT

> I DON'T REMEMBER.

#### KEVIN

> YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

#### VINCENT

> I DON'T REMEMBER BEING A CHILD LIKE YOU ARE.
> 
> IT'S ALL...BEEN LOST SOMEHOW.
> 
> I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING A MOTHER OR FATHER.

<BR><I>A moment of reflection passes.</i>

#### KEVIN

> THAT'S...SCARY.

#### VINCENT

> I SUPPOSE.
> 
> IT'S JUST HOW THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOR ME.

#### KEVIN

> I'LL NEVER FORGET WHERE I CAME FROM.
> 
> I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU AND MOTHER.

#### VINCENT

> I HOPE NOT.
> 
> I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN YOU OUT WITHOUT YOUR MOTHER'S HELP.

#### KEVIN

> THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE TRELAINE SAID. 
> 
> HE CLAIMED NOT JUST YOU, BUT MOTHER, TOO, WERE BOUND TO THIS PLANE.

#### VINCENT

> THAT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DISCUSS WITH HER.
> 
> BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR MOTHER DID NOT HAVE A MAGICKING FAMILY.
> 
> HER MOTHER DIED WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG AND HER FATHER, WHILE A KINDLY MAN, WAS ENTIRELY ORDINARY.
> 
> SHE WAS LONELY, VERY ALONE, AND HAD NO ONE TO GUIDE HER THROUGH THE DISCOVERY OF THE ARCANE.

#### KEVIN

> DID SHE MAKE A MISTAKE TOO?

#### VINCENT

> I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. 
> 
> BUT REALLY, YOU MUST SPEAK TO HER ABOUT IT.

#### KEVIN

> I WILL.
> 
> ...FATHER?

#### VINCENT

> YES?

#### KEVIN

> DO YOU THINK THE TALENT WILL EVER COME TO ME?
> 
> OR IS WHAT TRELAINE SAID TRUE?

#### VINCENT

> WHAT DID TRELAINE SAY TO YOU?

<BR><I>I could not say the word.</i>

#### KEVIN

> HE SAID THAT I'D CHANGE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.
> 
> THAT I'D BECOME...IMMORTAL.
> 
> THAT I'D NEVER DIE.

#### VINCENT

> EVERYONE DIES SOMEDAY.

#### KEVIN

> HE SAID...
> 
> HE SAID...

<BR><I>He held me close and stroked my hair.</i>

#### VINCENT

> SHH...IT'S OKAY.
> 
> I...DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

#### KEVIN

> DOES MOTHER KNOW?

#### VINCENT

> KEVIN...
> 
> PREDATION IS A NECESSARY PART OF LIFE.
> 
> THERE IS NO GIVE WITHOUT TAKE.
> 
> THERE IS NO FAULT IN ONE'S DESIRE TO KEEP ON LIVING.
> 
> FEEDING ON THE LIFEFORCE OF OTHERS IS NO WORSE THAN RAISING CATTLE FOR THE SLAUGHTER.
> 
> THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE BARBARIC FORMS OF SLAVERY.

#### KEVIN

> THERE'S ALWAYS VEGETARIANISM.

#### VINCENT

> AN ILLUSION, A PLATITUDE.
> 
> EXISTENCE IS ZERO-SUM.
> 
> A FARMER KILLS RABBITS AMONG HIS CABBAGES.
> 
> DO NOT THEIR LIVES COUNT FOR SOMETHING?

#### KEVIN

> I READ OF A RELIGION, ONCE, THAT COMMANDED ITS ADHERENTS TO EAT ONLY FRUIT AND NUT THAT HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND.

#### VINCENT

> A NOBLE CAUSE BUT ULTIMATELY IT DENIES THE TRUTH.
> 
> IS THE GUILT SO CONSUMING THAT YOU'LL RISK BEING ASLEEP ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT?

#### KEVIN

> WHAT ABOUT MOTHER'S CONJURATIONS?
> 
> SHE DOESN'T KILL.

#### VINCENT

> NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW CONJURATIONS COLLAPSE.
> 
> BUT WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME WE'RE OFF SCOT-FREE JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.

#### KEVIN

> BUT IT HAS TO BE BETTER THAN STEALING.

#### VINCENT

> VAMPIRISM IS CONSIDERED A CURSE FOR GOOD REASON.

<BR><I>The utterance sets me ill-at-ease. But at least it's clear what we're discussing. I open my mouth to speak but nothing sensible comes to mind.</i>

#### VINCENT

> THEFT IS A SERIOUS CRIME BUT THERE ARE WORSE.

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL.

#### VINCENT

> THEN YOU WILL AIM TO BE A MAN SO GREAT THAT YOUR TRESPASSES ARE FORGOTTEN.
> 
> BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DESERVE.
> 
> THAT IS THE COST OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING.

#### KEVIN

> GUILT?

#### VINCENT

> A PIOUS MAN COUNTS EACH AND EVERY STONE HE MUST CARRY.
> 
> HIS BACK WILL BECOME LADEN WITH SIN.
> 
> BUT HE WILL BEAR THIS LOAD BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T, WHO WILL?

#### KEVIN

> WHY MOVE STONES?

#### VINCENT

> IT IS MANKIND'S DESTINY TO CREATE ART.
> 
> ART REQUIRES A MEDIUM.
> 
> TO CREATE, TO THINK, ONE MUST EAT, ONE MUST CONSUME.
> 
> THAT IS THE UNIVERSAL CURSE THAT WE ALL SHARE.

#### KEVIN

> TRELAINE CLAIMS HE WANTS TO MAKE IT SO NO ONE EVER HAS TO SUFFER.

#### VINCENT

> AN ILLUSION THAT CAN NEVER BE ATTAINED.
> 
> OUR CURSE INFORMS US, EDUCATES US.
> 
> EACH CHOICE WE MAKE BECOMES A PART OF US.
> 
> BUT THE QUESTION FOLLOWS, WHICH CRIME IS WORSE, MURDER OR THEFT?

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT EITHER.

#### VINCENT

> BUT THE DAY MAY FALL TO YOU WHEN YOU WILL BE FORCED TO ACT.
> 
> WHEN TRELAINE STOLE YOU FROM US, I CHOSE TO STEAL YOU BACK.
> 
> PERHAPS I WILL FIND THAT THE GODS DID NOT APPROVE OF MY CHOICE TO TAKE REVENGE.
> 
> THAT IS SOMETHING I WILL HAVE TO ENDURE.
> 
> BUT I COULD NOT CALL MYSELF A FATHER IF I DID NOT RESTORE YOU TO YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR HOME.

#### KEVIN

> IT WAS TERRIBLE THERE.

#### VINCENT

> I BELIEVE YOU.
