### // THE LABORATORY //

<br><i>It's Friday. That means it's the last day of the week I have to talk to the Doctor Trelaine. It's been a trying week -- my teeth are gone. The gum is red and angry but it's not inflamed. I still maintain hope.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE PLACE I COME FROM.
> 
> IT HEARKENS OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO COME IN THE FUTURE.

#### KEVIN

> WHY DID YOU LEAVE?

#### TRELAINE

> I LEFT BECAUSE I HAD NO OPTION BUT TO LEAVE.
> 
> <U>MY PEOPLE</U> HAD NO OPTION BUT TO LEAVE.
> 
> IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.

<BR><I>He puts forth a moment for his assertion to percolate.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> YOU KNOW, YOUR UPBRINGING REMINDS ME OF MY OWN.
> 
> WE WERE BOTH RAISED BY UNUSUAL FAMILIES AND WERE SOMETHING OF ONLY CHILDREN AMONGST A CLUSTER OF OTHERS.

#### KEVIN

> THEN WE'RE NOT MUCH OF ONLY CHILDREN.

#### TRELAINE

> WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE ORPHANS AS YOUR SIBLINGS? 
> 
> EQUALS?

<BR><I>The other children my mother cared for did not seem to welcome me as their equal. But what did I know for certain? For all I knew, the little children may have asked about the quiet, reclusive boy who took all his meals in isolation.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> MY MOTHERS CARED FOR OTHER CHILDREN AS WELL.
> 
> BUT IN MY CASE, THEY WERE ALL MALE CHILDREN.
> 
> MY ELDERS BELIEVE IN STRONG SEGREGATION OF YOUNGLINGS.
> 
> I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN ENDORSE A MIXED-SEX ENVIRONMENT LIKE YOU WERE RAISED INTO.

<BR><I>The gender of the children I shared the school with never had made much difference to me one way or the other. Girl or boy, they were all strangers.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T SEE WHY IT MATTERS.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU DON'T SEE WHY IT MATTERS? 
> 
> THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE YOUNG.
> 
> YOU'LL SEE IN TIME THAT THERE ARE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES THAT CANNOT SIMPLY BE IGNORED.

#### KEVIN

> MY MOTHER IS NO LESS COMPETENT THAN MY FATHER.

#### TRELAINE

> I'M SURE THAT IS THE CASE.

<BR><I>I thought of indulging in a historical aside but think better of it. My context didn't feel well-grounded.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY MORE FEMALES THAN MALES EXPRESS TALENT?

<BR><I>The statistic is lost on me, who'd never met another mage in his life. I knew both boy-children and girl-children counted themselves among the ranks of the Orphans. I thought of their voices and longed for the safety of my home.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> PERHAPS YOU HAVE NOT LEARNED MUCH OF THE WAYS OF OURS. 
> 
> OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE DEFINITIVE NUMBERS BUT BASED ON THE FAMILIES WE KNOW ABOUT, FEMALES OUTNUMBER MALES BY ABOUT TWO TO ONE.
> 
> DON'T YOU THINK THAT SUGGESTS SOMETHING?

#### KEVIN

> I DON'T KNOW.

<BR><I>The Doctor Trelaine shifts his attention from the table to mill about the room distractedly.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> IN MY COUNTRY, CERTAIN JOBS WERE OPEN TO WOMEN AND CERTAIN JOBS WERE OPEN TO MEN.
> 
> I WAS TRAINED IN MY PROFESSION SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN.
> 
> MY MOTHERS PLANNED EVERYTHING FOR ME.
> 
> I NEVER HAD A FATHER. WHAT DID I NEED A FATHER FOR?
> 
> HOW WELL HAS YOUR FATHER TRULY DONE IN RAISING YOU?

<BR><I>I open my mouth to speak but he interrupts.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> I SHOULD SAY ASSIST IN RAISING YOU. 
> 
> YOUR MOTHER DID MOST OF THE HARD WORK, DID SHE NOT?

<BR><I>He was right that it was Mother who brought me three meals a day, clean clothes, new books. But the scant hours I'd spent with my father were precious to me and I wasn't ready to concede that it had all been a waste of time.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> SOULS ARE NOT SEXED, BUT BODIES ARE.
> 
> AND BODIES FORM THE DIRT THROUGH WHICH ALL MAGIC FLOWS.
> 
> EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS DIRT HAS DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND IS SUITED FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS.
> 
> LACED WITH PEBBLES IT CAN MAKE AN EXCELLENT FOUNDATION FOR A STRUCTURE.
> 
> THE SIEVE OF TIME SENDS TO THE SURFACE A SOFT AND DARK SUBSTANCE THAT NOURISHES THE TULIP.
> 
> YOU ONLY DO YOURSELF A DISHONOR BY TRYING TO APPLY LOAM TO A JOB REQUIRING STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE.
> 
> AND STILL MORE TRUE IS THAT A FLOWER CAN SIPHON NO NUTRITION FROM STONE.

#### KEVIN

> COULDN'T YOU JUST FILTER OUT THE PEBBLES?

#### TRELAINE

> AND THEN THE SOIL WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ONLY ONE THING. 
> 
> A NOBLE TASK, BUT STILL ONLY ONE CALLING AMONG MANY.
> 
> BOTH MALES AND FEMALES HAVE A PART TO PLAY IN THE NEW REGIME.
> 
> WE NEED ONLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR GIFTS ARE DIFFERENT.
> 
> AND PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT.

#### KEVIN

> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D HAVE MEN FILLING ROLES AS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND POLICE OFFICERS.

#### TRELAINE

> AMONG OTHER VOCATIONS.

#### KEVIN

> THAT'S NOT THE WAY MORTALS DO THINGS.

#### TRELAINE

> NO, IT'S NOT. 
> 
> BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

#### KEVIN

> THEY'RE NOT MAGICAL.
> 
> SO WHY SHOULD YOUR RULES APPLY?

#### TRELAINE

> THIS WORLD BELONGS TO MAGIC.
> 
> IT ALWAYS HAS AND IT ALWAYS WILL.

<BR><I>I had no particular nostalgia for the Mortal realm except for living adjacent to it. But the way in which the Doctor dismissed their existence was unnerving.</i>

#### KEVIN

> AND WHAT OF VAMPIRES?

#### TRELAINE

> VAMPIRES AREN'T MEANT TO EXIST. 
> 
> NOT HERE, NOT LIKE THIS. 
> 
> BUT WE'LL FIND A PLACE FOR EACH OF THEM.
> 
> MOST WILL TEND THE GARDEN AND ENSURE WE HAVE A HEALTHY CROP OF FLOWERS IN THE SPRING.
> 
> THEY HAVE NO NATURAL PLACE BUT WE CAN FIND A USE FOR THEM.
> 
> A CERAMIC GOOSE GUARDING THE BULBS FROM SCAVENGERS.
> 
> VAMPIRES ARE EVIDENCE OF A WORLD IN PERIL.

#### KEVIN

> BUT YOU...

#### TRELAINE

> I WAS CURSED.
> 
> THIS WAS SOMETHING NONE OF US COULD HAVE FORESEEN.
> 
> I BELIEVE IN FREE CHOICE BUT THIS ALSO MEANS SOME AMONG US WILL MAKE THE WRONG DECISION.
> 
> AND OTHERS WILL SUFFER FOR IT.
> 
> MY HOME SUFFERED FOR THE DECISION OF ONE MAN.
> 
> OUR UTOPIA CRUMBLED UNDERNEATH THE WEIGHT OF ONE MAN'S CRIMES.

#### KEVIN

> MAYBE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN YOUR UTOPIA.

#### TRELAINE

> AND YET HE WAS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.
> 
> HE WAS LIKE ME, DESTINED FROM BIRTH FOR A PURPOSE -- TO SERVE.
> 
> IT IS EVERYONE'S DUTY TO SERVE, AND HE SHIRKED THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
> 
> SELFISH AND SHORT-SIGHTED.
> 
> I HOPE NONE WILL EVER AGAIN STEAL FROM THE INNOCENT AND NEEDY. 
> 
> IF I AM ABLE TO SEE MY WILL BE DONE IT WILL NEVER AGAIN HAPPEN.
> 
> AT LEAST THE MEDITANT DOESN'T POSSESS THE POWER HE ONCE DID.
> 
> THAT, THE GODS HAVE TAKEN IN RETRIBUTION.
> 
> HE WIELDED MORE POWER THAN ANY SINGLE MAN WAS EVER MEANT TO HOLD.
> 
> MY PEOPLE WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN.
> 
> BLIND FAITH IS NOT AN AFFLICTION OF A PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN WRONGED.

#### KEVIN

> SO YOU AIM TO RECREATE YOUR HOMELAND IN PLACE OF WHAT THE MORTALS HAVE CREATED?

#### TRELAINE

> EXCEPT THIS TIME I WILL TOLERATE NO SINNERS TO DINE IN THE HALLS OF THE LORD.
> 
> I WILL DO WHAT OTHERS BEFORE ME HAVE FAILED TO DO.

#### KEVIN

> I DO NOT KNOW IF THE NATION OF MORTALS WILL ACCEPT YOUR RHETORIC.
> 
> THEY VALUE THEIR FREEDOM.

#### TRELAINE

> NO ONE IS FREE THAT SUFFERS A CRIMINAL TO LIVE.

#### KEVIN

> I WAS TAUGHT THAT IT IS WRONG TO KILL. 

#### TRELAINE

> AND WERE I LIVING IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THEY SO IMAGINE THEMSELVES IN, I MIGHT TOO AIM FOR A WORLD FREE FROM THE BRUTALITY OF DEATH. 
> 
> BUT THE SCARS OF OUR FAILURE RUN DEEP INTO THE PAST. 
> 
> IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN, MOST ORDINARY MORTALS WILL NEVER HAVE TO MEET OUR GHOSTS FACE TO FACE.
> 
> THEY'LL GO ON BELIEVING IN THEIR PARADISE JUST AS I WISH MY PEOPLE COULD DO.

<BR><I>I pause, leaving a palpable gap in the air.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE? 
> 
> SURELY YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PULL MY TEETH.

#### TRELAINE

> I WANT YOU TO JOIN ME, KEVIN.
> 
> YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE LINEAGE AND...

<BR><I>It was my turn to speak over him.</i>

#### KEVIN

> SO IT'S MY PEDIGREE THAT INTERESTS YOU.

#### TRELAINE

> IT IS NOT MERELY YOUR PEDIGREE. 
> 
> YOU ARE AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO DEFECT FROM THE LOSING SIDE.
> 
> YOUR FATHER'S KINGDOM HAS NO PLACE IN OUR FUTURE.
> 
> NOT AS IT IS NOW. 
> 
> WE'LL NEED TO REBUILD IT FROM THE GROUND UP.

#### KEVIN 

> SO YOU WANT TO MURDER MY FATHER.

#### TRELAINE

> I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO ACCEPT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION, I SUSPECT, HOWEVER, THAT HE WON'T GO ALONG QUIETLY. 

#### KEVIN

> PERHAPS HE HAS GOOD REASON TO REFUSE YOUR VISION.

#### TRELAINE

> THEN WE'LL SHOW HIM THE GLORY THAT WILL BE.

#### KEVIN

> "WE" NOTHING. 
> 
> AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, I'M A PRISONER BEING HELD AGAINST MY WILL. 

#### TRELAINE

> I TRULY HOPE YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

#### KEVIN

> I TRULY DOUBT THAT I WILL.

#### TRELAINE

> YOU THINK YOUR FATHER IS COMING TO RESCUE YOU BUT HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO FIND YOU?
> 
> WALKING THE PLANES IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU MAY BE AWARE. 
> 
> YOU ARE IN A DEMI-PLANE, KEVIN.
> 
> IT BELONGS TO ME.

<BR><I>I try to stay strong against the opposition but his assertion nags at my doubt.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MY MOTHER IS A POWERFUL WITCH --

#### TRELAINE

> WHO HAS EVEN LESS OF A CHANCE OF GETTING HERE. 
> 
> SHE WAS SOLD THE FALSE GOSPEL EARLY IN HER LIFE AND SHE SUFFERS DUE TO IT. 
> 
> YOUR MOTHER HAS RAISED THAT SCHOOL SINGLE-HANDEDLY.
> 
> WHAT HAS YOUR FATHER DONE EXCEPT SERVE AS A FIGUREHEAD, A MASCOT, FOR THAT PLACE?

<BR><I>I have often wondered why I did not hear Father's voice among the Orphans' but the truth seemed self-evident.</i>

#### TRELAINE

> HE IS IN A PLACE HE DOES NOT BELONG.
> 
> LET US JUST SUPPOSE HIS CLAIM TO ROYALTY IS TRUE.
> 
> LET US JUST SUPPOSE.
> 
> EVERY DAY HE LAYS IN REST BENEATH THIS SCHOOL WHILE CHILDREN WORK MIRACLES ABOVE HIS HEAD.
> 
> WHY DOESN'T HE RETURN TO WHERE HE CAME FROM? 
> 
> WHAT CRIME COULD HE POSSIBLY BE PAYING PENANCE FOR?

<BR>
