### // MARSCAPONE APARTMENTS // 

<br><i>It is the evening of VLADISLAUS STRAUD's New Year's Eve FÃªte. It marks a day of fasting for the Vampires; he has customarily requested each of the invited to refrain from dining on 'last year's sorrows'. For the Elders, this is less of a concession than it is for the young. </I>

<i>Adjacent to the School known as the MAGICADEMY sits a cluster of townhomes owned by MYRTLE MARSCAPONE. Inside one of these apartments dwell the vampires KEVIN, CEDRIC, now left largely to their own devices following the death of the esteemed Elder VINCENT MARSCAPONE. </i>

<I>The night rises and CEDRIC begins to stir from sleep's solitude.</i>

<i>He pushes off the top of his coffin and one edge clatters down, sound only slightly dampened by the presence of a threadbare carpet.</i>

<i>To one side of him on the floor lays a plain coffin in dark wood, top still in place. The air is heavy with silence.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> (thinking) Kev, you up?
> 
> (thinking) ... Kev?

<br><i>But he says nothing.</i>

<i>CEDRIC rises from the padded interior of his sleeping arrangement and takes a seat at a nearby piano.</i>

<i>How this instrument got into the basement has always been a mystery to the young vampire. Was it constructed here? Was it placed before the building was fully constructed? Was it brought in parts? He knew VINCENT was knowledgable in many subjects but the finer art of piano construction was not one he'd thought was in his purview.</i>

<i>But ever since the Elder had left, it had increasingly seemed prudent to accept the way things were, rather than wish for something else, to hearken back to a time long past with questions that didn't need to be asked.</i>

<i>He flips through some sheet music and settles on a familiar theme, plunking through the opening notes gently, repeating each motion until he can achieve even the faintest claim of ease.</i>

<i>The noise wouldn't stir KEVIN's otherworldly slumber, though it does pass the time and lessen the anxiety that clouds CEDRIC's thoughts in the quiet chamber.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>There was evidence of past rainfall when they approached the car.</i>

#### KEVIN

> DID YOU KEEP TO STRAUD'S REQUEST THIS YEAR?

<BR><I>He hadn't last year.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH. I DID.

<BR><I>KEVIN drives the car from the driveway. CEDRIC waits until the car is completely clear of the driveway before closing the gate and locking it. He gets into the car and slams the door shut.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> OLD FOGEY CAN PROBABLY SMELL IT ON US.

#### KEVIN

> HE'S BEEN PRETTY LENIENT WITH YOU.
> 
> I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S US HE'S TARGETING.

#### CEDRIC

> EH.
> 
> THOUGHT I'D SEND OUT AN OLIVE BRANCH THIS YEAR.
> 
> FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

#### KEVIN

> NEVER HURTS TO BE DIPLOMATIC.

#### CEDRIC

> HURTS ME.

### // STRAUD MANSION //

<BR><I>The car curls into place outside the Jamaica Estates home. No one else has arrived.</i>

<i>They knock, wait, and STRAUD answers the door.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WELCOME, FRIENDS.

<BR><i>CEDRIC had always thought the line would be better finished with the term 'children', though he balked at the idea of being referred to in such a way.</i>

#### KEVIN

> COUNT. 
> 
> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

#### STRAUD

> FIRST IN, LAST OUT.

<BR><I>It was common knowledge that once the bell tolled, the vampires oft scattered, eager to partake of the young humans when boozy and agreeable. STRAUD's comment was hardly a threat.</i>

<i>The foyer is dimly lit with candles and a dusty chandelier.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THANK YOU, BOYS, FOR COMING.
> 
> IT IS GOOD TO KNOW I WILL NOT HAVE TO SPEND THE YEAR'S BIRTH ALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS.

#### KEVIN

> YOU KNOW EVERYONE LOOKS FORWARD TO THE GET-TOGETHER.

#### STRAUD

> LOOKING FORWARD TO A CONCLUSION OF AN EVENT IS NOT THE SAME AS ANTICIPATING THE EVENT ITSELF.
> 
> REGARDLESS.
> 
> CEDRIC.
> 
> I HAVE A MATTER ABOUT WHICH I'D LIKE TO SPEAK.

<BR><I>KEVIN took this opportunity to walk up the stairs to his left and leave the entryway.</i>

#### STRAUD

> PLEASE COME HAVE A SEAT IN THE SITTING ROOM.

<BR><I>A fire roars in the hearth. CEDRIC, STRAUD sit on catty-corner couches.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I WANT YOU TO PLEDGE YOURSELF TO OBOROVSKY.

<BR><I>SVETLANA OBOROVSKY was a name with which he was familiar, though they had never spoken. She occasionally made an appearance on the wIntraNet, though she often seemed distracted.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I THOUGHT <U>YOU</U> WERE TO TAKE ON VINCENT'S STUDENTS.

#### STRAUD

> I DID, AND I HAVE.
> 
> I AM NOT REFUSING YOUR SERVICE. THERE IS STILL MUCH I CAN TEACH YOU.
> 
> SHE IS WISE. SHE IS NOT OF MY LINEAGE. THERE IS MUCH SHE KNOWS THAT I DO NOT.

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SHIRK YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

#### STRAUD

> I DON'T APPRECIATE THE ACCUSATION.

#### CEDRIC

> ISN'T SHE CAUGHT IN THE HALF-DREAM?

#### STRAUD

> THAT'S WHAT MARSCAPONE THOUGHT.
> 
> SHE IS LUCID EXCEPT FOR PREDICTABLE FITS. I DON'T THINK HER ILLNESS WILL TROUBLE YOU.

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOU WANT ME TO TRAIN WITH SOME HALF-SANE VAMPRESS--
> 
> WHAT.
> 
> ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME?

#### STRAUD

> HARDLY.

#### CEDRIC

> THEN WHAT IS IT?

#### STRAUD

> YOU NEED SOMEONE. SHE NEEDS SOMEONE.
> 
> IT SEEMS A NATURAL FIT.

#### CEDRIC

> SO YOU'RE PLAYING AT BEING A MATCHMAKER.

#### STRAUD

> IT WOULD BE EASIER IF YOU SIMPLY REGARDED THIS AS A BUSINESS MATTER.

#### CEDRIC

> AND WHAT ABOUT SEBASTIAN?

#### STRAUD

> THE TWO ARE SEPARATED.
> 
> AMICABLY.
> 
> BUT SEPARATED NONE-THE-LESS.

<BR><I>STRAUD removes a knife from his jacket pocket and flips it open. He runs his finger down the blade.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T WANT A YOUNGLING AS MY MASTER.

#### STRAUD

> I WANT YOU TO ACT YOUR AGE.

#### CEDRIC

> PLEDGE ME TO VATORE.

#### STRAUD

> LET ME BE CLEAR WITH YOU, CEDRIC.
> 
> THIS IS NOT A CHOICE.
> 
> YOU WILL TRAIN WITH OBOROVSKY.
> 
> BESIDES WHICH.

<BR><I>STRAUD turns the knife around and uses it to remove a speck of dirt from underneath his fingernails.</i>

#### STRAUD

> SHE PLAYS WORLD OF WARCRAFT.

<BR>

*****
<BR><i>CEDRIC feigns interest in KEVIN's piano while vampires slowly appear at the party.</i>

#### KEVIN

> WELL, I HAD NO IDEA SHE PLAYED.
> 
> SMALL WORLD.

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH.
> 
> SMALL FUCKING WORLD.

#### KEVIN

> HE'S NOT PUSHING YOU AWAY.
> 
> JUST WANTS YOU TO GET NEW EXPERIENCES.
> 
> SVETLANA'S A TALENTED SHAPESHIFTER, I'VE HEARD.

#### CEDRIC

> YEAH, THAT'S REALLY WHAT I GIVE A FUCK ABOUT.
> 
> RUNNING AROUND LIKE A BEAST.
> 
> THANKS BUT NO THANKS.
> 
> I'VE DONE MY TIME. 

<BR><I>CEDRIC's acerbic tone ends the commentary. KEVIN continues to play. CEDRIC leans against the instrument and stares at the wall-hangings.</i>

<i>His focus is, however, soon interrupted.</i>

#### STRAUD

> CEDRIC, CEDRIC.

<BR><I>CEDRIC turns his head back into the throngs of people.</i>

<i>STRAUD approaches with a slight woman in a long black dress. She has hair to match, drawn up in a tight updo. One lock of hair has been loosened from its grasp.</i>

<i>She <u>is</u> beautiful.</i>

#### STRAUD

> CEDRIC, MEET SVETLANA OBOROVSKY.
> 
> MY LADY, THIS IS CEDRIC.

<BR><I>SVETLANA clasps the sides of her dress and curtsies.</i> 

#### CEDRIC

> IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

#### SVETLANA

> AND YOU. 
> 
> THE COUNT HAS TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

<BR><I>CEDRIC's jaw tightens.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> (thinking) I'm sure she just means to be polite, but...

<br><i>At the strange pause, KEVIN stops his playing and turns to join in the conversation.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE MY INTRUSION, BUT...
> 
> CEDRIC LOATHES BEING THE OBJECT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CONVERSATIONS.

<BR><I>Her expression softens, apologetic.</i>

#### SVETLANA

> OH, OF COURSE!
> 
> DON'T WE ALL?

#### STRAUD

> IF YOU'LL FORGIVE THE EXPRESSION, CEDRIC.
> 
> IT'S AN OLD TURN OF PHRASE.

#### CEDRIC

> OF COURSE.

#### SVETLANA

> THE COUNT TELLS ME YOU TWO PLAY WORLD OF WARCRAFT.

<BR><I>Without saying a word, STRAUD turns and disappears into the crowd.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> (thinking) Of course, he's gone.
> 
> (thinking) Yet another.

<BR><I>CEDRIC glares toward STRAUD's escape route, paying no heed to the conversation at hand.

#### KEVIN

> I PLAY A PRIEST.

<br><i>KEVIN pokes CEDRIC with his elbow.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> ME? OH. UH.
> 
> ORC HUNTER.

#### SVETLANA

> ORC HUNTER, HUH?
> 
> SO YOU TWO ARE HORDE SCUM.

#### KEVIN

> YOU TAKE THAT BACK!
> 
> I AM A HUMAN. OR, AT LEAST, I WAS BORN A HUMAN.
> 
> BEFORE THE HUMANS SAID THEY WANTED NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH ME.

#### SVETLANA

> WELL MAYBE YOU'D HAVE MORE FRIENDS IF YOU'D STOP INFECTING THEM WITH PLAGUE AND BURNING DOWN THEIR FORESTS.

#### KEVIN

> THAT ONE WASN'T MY IDEA.

#### SVETLANA

> NIGHT ELF DRUID.

#### KEVIN

> NICE. TELDRASSIL IS BEAUTIFUL.

#### CEDRIC

> IT'S. 
> 
> CURSED.

#### KEVIN

> YEAH, IT'S CURSED, BUT IT'S STILL BEAUTIFUL.
> 
> AND THE NIGHT ELF MUSIC IS EXCELLENT.
> 
> I REALLY LOVE THE STARTING ZONE.
> 
> CEDRIC HERE IS JUST GRUMPY HIS TOONS ALL START OUT IN BROWN TOWN.

#### SVETLANA

> 'BROWN TOWN'?!
> 
> HAHA. I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

#### KEVIN

> YEAH, GOT THAT ONE FROM A FEW OF MY FRIENDS.

#### SVETLANA

> SO WHY HORDE, THEN?

<BR><I>The question fades for a moment into the noise of the party.</i>

<i>CEDRIC breaks the silence.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> I WANTED TO ROLL HUNTER BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY AN ELF OR A DWARF.
