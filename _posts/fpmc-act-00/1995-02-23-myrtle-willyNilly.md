### // THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

<br><i>The sound of the silver bell still rings in Myrtle's mind. It all seemed like it could be something simple. They've had their 'Eureka!' moment already.</i>

<i>Magic was feeling increasingly limited and Myrtle felt very small, very helpless.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST GO THERE?

<BR><I>She had only the faintest impression of what schemes of magic were open to the Count.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WOMAN, DON'T YOU KNOW A LICK ABOUT PLANESMAGICK?

<BR><I>Straud was surprisingly caustic, seeming quickly irritable.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I DO KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT.

#### STRAUD

> WELL EVEN IF I KNOW THE CAUSE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M SIMPLY ABLE TO STEP FOOT ON HIS PLANE WILLY-NILLY.
> 
> THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF KEY TO OPEN THE WAY.
> 
> AND IF IT'S NOT THE DOCTOR TRELAINE...

#### MYRTLE

> THEN WHAT?

<BR><I>He pauses dramatically, trying to allow her space to answer her own question.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THEN I'VE OPENED WAR ON HIM BY SETTING FOOT UPON HIS HOME PLANE.
> 
> EVEN ASSUMING THAT'S WHERE HE WENT.
> 
> IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS A SCRY, AND EVEN IF IT WERE, I POSSESS NO PHYSICAL OBJECTS FROM WHICH TO DRAW A SOURCE.

#### MYRTLE

> BUT SURELY THERE MUST BE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

#### STRAUD

> I DON'T KNOW, MADAM.

#### MYRTLE

> HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO TAKE KEVIN, THEN?

#### STRAUD

> HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR THEM.

#### MYRTLE

> BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE'D BE ABLE TO LEAVE.

#### STRAUD

> WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

<BR><I>She stutters, unsure of what she wants to say.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I DON'T KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT...

<BR><I>Vincent, silent to this point, rejoins the conversation.</i>

#### VINCENT

> SHE THOUGHT HE WAS BOUND TO OUR PLANE.

#### STRAUD

> WELL APPARENTLY NOT. 
> 
> I ASSUME YOU'VE SEARCHED THE HOUSE.

#### MYRTLE

> YES, EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.

#### STRAUD

> THEN HE IS CERTAINLY NOT BOUND TO YOUR HOME.

<BR><I>Myrtle seems caught, preoccupied.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WHERE IS THE DOOR?

#### MYRTLE

> WHICH DOOR?

#### STRAUD

> THE DOOR FROM WHICH HE LEFT THE HOUSE.

#### MYRTLE

> DOWN ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE SCHOOL.

<BR><I>They track downstairs. They open the door and stare out on a quiet street.</i>

<i>Vincent stops still, caught in a moment of concentration.</i>

<I>He smells something.</i>

#### VINCENT

> A FOUL ODOR.

<BR><I>Straud looks at him. His serene expression seems to encourage Vincent.</i>

#### VINCENT

> IT'S A CHEMICAL. 
> 
> A STRONG ACID?
> 
> A PEPPER?

#### STRAUD

> FOCUS.

#### MYRTLE

> DO YOU THINK THEY ATTACKED HIM?

<BR><I>The three observe a moment of silent reflection.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

#### MYRTLE

> BUT THEY USED NON-MAGICAL MEANS.

#### STRAUD

> THEY MAY HAVE FELT THEY NEEDED NOTHING STRONGER IF YOUR BOY WAS INCAPABLE OF FIGHTING BACK.
> 
> BESIDES WHICH.
> 
> THAT WHICH ORIGINATES FROM THE PRIME MATERIAL PLANE MAY TRAVEL FREELY WITHIN IT.

#### VINCENT

> TEARGAS.
> 
> AEROSOL.

#### STRAUD

> IT'S A PARTICULARLY STRONG WEAPON MORTALS USE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.
> 
> A SPRAY.
> 
> OFTEN IN THE EYES AS THAT OFFERS THE MOST IMMOBILIZING POTENTIAL.

#### MYRTLE

> SOMEONE USED A CHEMICAL WEAPON AGAINST KEVIN?

#### STRAUD 

> IF YOUR HUSBAND'S SENSE OF SMELL IS TO BE TRUSTED.

<BR><I>Vincent turns his attention back to Straud and Myrtle.</i>

#### VINCENT 

> YES, I'M SURE OF IT.

#### STRAUD

> THEN HE MAY NOT HAVE GONE OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.
> 
> HE MAY HAVE BEEN SUBDUED.

#### MYRTLE

> NO, HE COULDN'T HAVE RUN AWAY.
> 
> WE'VE TAKEN CARE TO PROVIDE FOR HIS EVERY WANT.

<BR><I>Straud looks between the two worried faces.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> I SUSPECT, IF IT IS MY OLD ASSOCIATE, THEN HE MAY WANT TO SEQUENCE HIS GENETIC MATERIAL.

#### MYRTLE

> 'SEQUENCE HIS GENETIC MATERIAL'?
> 
> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

<BR><I>But the remaining man seems distracted.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WHAT IF IT'S NOT LENARD.
> 
> WHAT IF IT'S SOMETHING GREATER?

#### STRAUD

> THEN WE MAY BE POWERLESS TO STOP THEM.

<BR><I>Myrtle buries her head in her hands, her voice now muffled by the retraction.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> OH, MY BOY.
> 
> MY DEAR, DEAR BOY.

<BR><I>Straud allows Myrtle a moment of grief before speaking again.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I'LL COME BACK TOMORROW AND GIVE A LECTURE TO THE ORPHANS.

#### MYRTLE

> YOU'LL COME BACK TOMORROW? 
> 
> BUT I INSIST...

#### STRAUD

> IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT I SEE HOW KEVIN LIVED.
> 
> IF I'M TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF SEEING WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.
> 
> IT WILL BE NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY, PERHAPS ON THE NATURE OF DRAWING ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.

#### MYRTLE

> BUT COUNT...

#### STRAUD

> PLEASE ALLOW ME THIS.

<BR><I>She steps back her protestations, wondering them sensible or out of a misplaced sense of propriety.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> OF COURSE.

#### STRAUD

> CAN YOU DRIVE ME HOME, VINCENT? 
> 
> I'LL WANT TO PREPARE.

#### VINCENT

> OF COURSE.

<BR>
