### // THE MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC //

#### MYRTLE 

> ARE YOU REALLY GOING THROUGH WITH IT?

<BR><I>Myrtle sits with her husband on the back stoop of their house. Just about fifteen minutes earlier, the Count Vladislaus Straud IV had left, taking his associate Quarq with him.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> HE WAS...

<BR><I>She struggles to conjure an appropriate observation.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> ...NICE ENOUGH.
> 
> HOW WILL YOU BE SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT INJURED BY THE BLAST?

<BR><I>The trio had discussed at length the types of weapons Quarq had access to but had stayed suspiciously away from safety precautions.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I WANT BOTH OF YOU TO RETURN HOME TO ME.

#### VINCENT

> IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

#### MYRTLE

> HOW CAN YOU KNOW? 
> 
> HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN?

#### VINCENT

> I CAN'T BE CERTAIN, YOU KNOW THAT.
> 
> YOU KNOW I'LL TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION.
> 
> WHEN I BEGIN A MISSION I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO ENSURE IT COMES TRUE.

<BR><I>He watches in silence, through the side of his vision as Myrtle draws a pack of cigarettes from a pocket of her dressing gown.</i>

#### VINCENT

> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT SMOKERS.

<BR><I>She removes a cigarette from the packet and brings it up to her mouth. In a single flick of her fingers, a sizzle emits and it is lit.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> NOW WHICH OF US IS SPOUTING OFF THE WISDOM OF THE MORTALS?

<BR><I>Vincent chuckles.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I JUST...

<BR><I>She seizes as if holding back a tear.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> WHAT DO I DO IF YOU LEAVE ME A WIDOW?

<BR><I>She wipes at her face with the side of her sleeve.</i>

> #### VINCENT
> 
> > WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

<BR><I>She draws on the cigarette, then winces.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> IT'S LIKE GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

#### VINCENT

> DOES THIS MEAN I HAVE TO REVOKE YOUR COIN?

#### MYRTLE

> DON'T YOU DARE.

#### VINCENT

> TRY NOT TO WORRY.

#### MYRTLE

> EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
> 
> YOU'RE NOT THE ONE HAVING TO SIT ON HER HANDS BECAUSE SHE'S POWERLESS TO ENACT ANY REAL CHANGE.

#### VINCENT

> I COULD BRING YOU WITH ME.

#### MYRTLE

> WHO WOULD WATCH THE CHILDREN?

#### VINCENT

> YOU RAISE A COMPELLING PROBLEM.
> 
> YOU HAVE FRIENDS.

#### MYRTLE

> A FEW, BUT...YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.

#### VINCENT

> THE MARSCAPONES, WITH MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF CHILDREN IN TOW, CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF THEIR ONLY SON.

#### MYRTLE

> WE'D BE WORSE THAN SIMPLY AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE.

#### VINCENT

> I ONLY JEST.

#### MYRTLE

> I KNOW...

<BR><I>She sniffles, trying to maintain her composure.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I ALSO KNOW YOU'LL BE FINE, AND I NEED ONLY HAVE FAITH.

#### VINCENT

> DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

<BR><I>She sends him a sideways reproachful glance.</i>

#### VINCENT

> OH YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

#### MYRTLE

> I'M JUST SCARED.

#### VINCENT

> I KNOW YOU ARE.

#### MYRTLE

> YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER...BEYOND, EVEN...

#### VINCENT

> IS IT THE EXPLOSIVES?

#### MYRTLE

> MAYBE IT IS, MAYBE IT ISN'T. 
> 
> IT'S CERTAINLY FAR FROM MY USUAL BAG OF TRICKS.
> 
> BUT MAYBE IT'S NECESSARY...
> 
> MAYBE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TEACH A LESSON TO THOSE THAT WOULD STEAL FROM US.

#### VINCENT

> DAMN RIGHT IT IS.
> 
> I DON'T PLAN ON LETTING THIS ASSHOLE GET AWAY WITH WHAT HE'S DONE.

#### MYRTLE

> AND THAT'S WHY I TRUST YOU.
> 
> IT'S JUST NOT MY USUAL.

#### VINCENT

> REVENGE?

#### MYRTLE

> REVENGE.

#### VINCENT

> SOMETIMES YOU MUST SHOW OTHERS THAT YOU ARE WORTHY OF RESPECT.
> 
> IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SELF-PRESERVATION.
> 
> DO YOU WANT A FATHER WHO ISN'T WILLING TO GO THE EXTRA MILE FOR YOU?

#### MYRTLE

> I...SUPPOSE NOT.
> 
> NO.

#### VINCENT

> YOUR GOD TEACHES AN EYE FOR AN EYE, DOES HE NOT?

#### MYRTLE

> HE ALSO TEACHES ONE TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

#### VINCENT

> THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF SLAPPING SOMEONE WHO MAKES A RUDE COMMENT AT COURT.
> 
> THIS IS OUR SON!
> 
> OUR FAMILY DESERVES BETTER.

<BR><I>Water has gathered in the corners of Myrtle's eyes and she can't grant him eye contact.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I KNOW IT.
> 
> BUT IT STILL HURTS.
> 
> THERE ARE LIKELY INNOCENTS THAT WILL BE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.

#### VINCENT

> AND WHAT IF THERE AREN'T? 
> 
> WHAT IF EVERYONE THERE IS THERE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL?

<BR><I>She stays silent a moment. Smoke fills the air.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> THEN...I SUPPOSE THERE ARE RISKS FOR EVERY ACTION WE TAKE.

#### VINCENT

> I DON'T LIKE IT ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.
> 
> BUT THIS MAN IS A MANIAC.
> 
> A CRUEL MOCKERY.

#### MYRTLE

> I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.

#### VINCENT

> HE WEARS A DOCTOR'S COAT AND TITLE BUT HE'S LONG AGO FORSAKEN ANY TRUE LOVE FOR CARING FOR THE MORTALS.

#### MYRTLE

> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE THE CASE.

#### VINCENT

> IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW PEOPLE LIKE HIM THAT THEY WON'T SIMPLY GET AWAY WITH THEIR CRIMES.

#### MYRTLE

> THAT I CAN AGREE WITH.
> 
> I JUST HOPE WE AREN'T MOVING OUR SUFFERING TO SOMEONE ELSE.

#### VINCENT

> AND THAT IS JUST ONE REASON I LOVE YOU, DEAR WIFE.
> 
> YOU'RE ALWAYS THINKING OF SOMEONE ELSE.

> #### VINCENT
> 
> > WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

#### VINCENT

> YOU'VE TAKEN ON A HOUSE OF CHILDREN AND YOU STILL FIND CONSIDERATION FOR THE MORTALS.

#### MYRTLE

> THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.

#### VINCENT

> ONE DOES NOT FIND ONESELF IN THE EMPLOY OF A MAN LIKE TRELAINE WITHOUT INTENT.
> 
> I'M SURE EACH OF THEM HAS BEEN PROMISED THE MOON. 
> 
> BUT FOLLOWING TRELAINE MEANS A FAILURE OF JUDGING CHARACTER, SOMETHING EACH MAN DEAD OR ALIVE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO.

#### MYRTLE

> WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER OUR CHOICES.

#### VINCENT

> THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHOICE OF REBELLION.

#### MYRTLE

> AND WHAT ABOUT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE?
> 
> WHAT MEANS DO THE MORTALS HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST A BLOOD MAGE?

#### VINCENT

> NOT MUCH, I ADMIT.

#### MYRTLE

> HE COULD HAVE THREATENED THEIR LIVELIHOOD.
> 
> THREATENED <U>THEIR</U> FAMILIES.

#### VINCENT

> AND YET WOULDN'T GOD STILL SEE THEIR COWARDICE? 
> 
> A MORTAL WHO CHOOSES TEMPORARY SAFETY AT THE HANDS OF A TYRANT...

#### MYRTLE

> WE ALL HAVE OUR SINS TO ATONE FOR.
> 
> I JUST TRY NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE HIGHER JUDGEMENT.
> 
> WORSE YET WE APPEAR TO BE TAKING JUSTICE INTO OUR OWN HANDS.

#### VINCENT

> THERE IS A KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR PHILOSOPHY AND MINE. 
> 
> I DON'T BELIEVE TAKING ACTION IS A BAD THING.
> 
> WE CANNOT SIMPLY WAIT FOR OUR GODS TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS. 
> 
> OUR TIME ON EARTH WAS GIVEN TO US NOT TO WAIT, BUT TO ACT, TO LOVE, TO FIGHT. 
> 
> WE WILL BE JUDGED BY OUR ACTIONS AND OF THOSE ACTIONS, CHOOSING NOT TO ACT IS STILL A CHOICE.

#### MYRTLE

> AND I CAN SEE THE MERIT IN YOUR APPROACH.

#### VINCENT

> YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE BY IT, NOT CONTENTED TO LEAVE THE ORPHANS TO THEIR FATES. 

#### MYRTLE

> IT'S JUST...THE VIOLENCE.

#### VINCENT

> I KNOW IT'S A LOT. 
> 
> BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE DECK IS STACKED IN OUR FAVOR.
> 
> I'LL SLAY THE OPPOSITION ONE-BY-ONE IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET KEVIN BACK.

#### MYRTLE

> AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER.

#### VINCENT

> I'M A LOUSY FATHER.
> 
> BUT AT LEAST I CAN DO THIS FOR HIM.

<BR>
