*****
<BR><I>It has been a inward-facing autumn for the allies of VLADISLAUS STRAUD. In a foreboding mansion in JAMAICA ESTATES sits the darkly-bricked STRAUD MANSION. Inside the house are sheltered three vampires. The evening has come, welcome.</I>

#### STRAUD

> I NEED TO MAKE A DELIVERY TO MARSCAPONE.

#### MANDARC

> MORE PLASMA PACKS?

<BR><I>There is a hint of dismissiveness in his voice but STRAUD ignores it.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE HE'S REQUESTED A DROP-OFF.
> 
> I CONSIDER IT AN OFFERING OF GOOD-WILL.

#### MANDARC

> LET ME COME WITH YOU.

#### STRAUD

> YOU'D LIKE AVAEL TO WATCH THE HOUSE?

#### MANDARC

> SHE'S MORE THAN CAPABLE.

#### STRAUD

> HOW DO YOU EVER EXPECT TO RECEIVE A PROMOTION?

#### MANDARC 

> BY PROTECTING YOU WHILE YOU'RE OUT OF DOORS.

#### STRAUD

> I NEED NOT YOUR... PROTECTIONS.
> 
> BESIDES WHICH.

<BR><I>A slight smile grows beneath STRAUD's moustache.</i>

#### STRAUD

> DON'T YOU HAVE CARTOONS TO WATCH?

#### MANDARC

> SINCE YOU'VE GOT THE DVR, I CAN WATCH AT ANY TIME.
> 
> THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

#### STRAUD

> SO YOU'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO WORK IT.

#### MANDARC

> I CAN SHOW YOU HOW, IF YOU'D LIKE.

#### STRAUD 

> ... NO NEED.
> 
> THANK YOU.

<BR><I>KEVIN MARSCAPONE lives across the borough; to accomplish the requisite task requires the assistance of a car. MANDARC doesn't drive.</i>

<I>STRAUD hates driving. But he does it anyway; to teach yet another young person the rules of the road is something for which right now he doesn't have the energy.</i>

<BR>

*****
<BR><I>It is a cool, crisp night. The worst rush of the nighttime traffic has passed and the ride from JAMAICA ESTATES to ASTORIA passes without event.</i>

<i>The pair pull up against the curb in front of the MARSCAPONE SCHOOL OF MAGIC.</I>

<I>But they hesitate to get out of the car.</i>

<i>Sitting on the stoop is a young woman with wavy brown hair.</i>

#### MANDARC

> WHO THE HELL...

<BR><I>But STRAUD raises his right hand to silence the man.</i>

<i>She looks half, or more, asleep. On her lap, wrapped in a hand gone slack, is a cellphone.</i>

<i>STRAUD opens his car door and steps out, approaching the fence.</I>

<i>He slips a key into the lock, causing the metal housing to squeak loudly, sending a jolt through the stoop girl. MANDARC is climbing out of the car.</i>

<i>STRAUD speaks loudly and assertively.</i>

#### STRAUD

> EVENING, MISS. CAN I HELP YOU?

<BR><I>The strange woman has bright red eyes. She's almost certainly NOT a Mundane.</i>

#### PERKINS

> I... UH...
> 
> I WAS WAITING ON KEVIN.
> 
> DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE'LL BE BACK?

<BR><I>The woman gives the pair a look-over, now eyeing the approaching MANDARC, weaving his way through the squeaking fence.</i>

<i>Realizing how she appears, she brushes off her outerwear and tries to regain any air of legitimacy. She slips her cellphone into her coat pocket.</i>

#### PERKINS

> I'M FRIDAY PERKINS.
> 
> I'M A STUDENT -- FORMER STUDENT -- OF MYRTLE MARSCAPONE.

#### STRAUD

> THEN YOU'RE FORMER OF A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE.
> 
> THE MATRON HAS DISMISSED HER STUDENTS.

#### PERKINS

> I...
> 
> I AM UNFORTUNATELY AWARE THAT THE HEADMISTRESS IS NO LONGER TAKING STUDENTS, BUT...
> 
> I -- I WAS HOPING TO GET A RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER STUDY.
> 
> AT UNIVERSITY.

<BR><I>She seemed to have hoped that the claim would earn some esteem from her audience. Unfortunately it falls on deaf ears.</i>

#### PERKINS

> DO YOU KNOW IF THE HEADMISTRESS --

<BR><I>STRAUD is losing patience with the conversation. He is not in the habit of playing messenger.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THE MATRON MARSCAPONE IS CERTAINLY NOT COMING BACK HERE TONIGHT.
> 
> I REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT SHE HAS RETIRED.
> 
> AS IN --
> 
> SHE TAKES RESIDENCE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

#### PERKINS

> DO YOU KNOW WHEN KEVIN WILL BE BACK, THEN?

<BR><I>STRAUD raises a thin eyebrow.</i>

#### STRAUD

> ARE YOU... ACQUAINTED?

<BR><I>She tries to muster a polite demeanor, but no smile graces her face.</i>

#### PERKINS

> HE WOULD KNOW ME, YES.

<BR><I>STRAUD remains still, listening to each word.</i>

#### PERKINS

> YES, PERHAPS... HE -- 
> 
> -- COULD LEAD ME TO WHERE THE HEADMISTRESS HAS RETIRED...?

<BR><I>MANDARC shifts about uncomfortably. STRAUD maintains a statuesque stillness. His voice just barely indicates his decreasing tolerance of the woman's prying.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEAVE A NOTE...

<BR><I>FRIDAY speaks with sudden brightness --</i>

#### PERKINS

> DO YOU HAVE A KEY?

<BR><I>STRAUD allows for a stiff pause in the conversation.</i>

#### STRAUD

> ... YES. 
> 
> I DO.
> 
> I WAS SENT OVER TO BRING IN THE PAPER.
> 
> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TAKE YOUR NOTE IN THE HOUSE?

#### PERKINS

> MY LETTER IS DUE IN A WEEK.
> 
> I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MISSUS MARSCAPONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
> 
> IN PERSON.

<br><i>STRAUD is irritated and refuses immediate reply. MANDARC, instead, seizes the moment.</i>

#### MANDARC

> THAT'S HARDLY OUR PROBLEM, MISS.
> 
> PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED YOUR APPLICATION EARLIER.

<BR><I>FRIDAY breaks into polite deference, unwilling to show an ounce of irritation at the interloper.</i>

#### PERKINS

> I...
> 
> YOU'RE RIGHT. 
> 
> I SHOULD HAVE DONE MY APPLICATION SOONER.
> 
> THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN TAKE ME.

#### STRAUD

> I'LL CALL HER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, MISS.
> 
> IF YOU'LL LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER WITH MY ASSISTANT.

#### PERKINS

> OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
> 
> THAT WOULD BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL.
> 
> THANK YOU.
