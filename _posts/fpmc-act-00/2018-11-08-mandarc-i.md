*****
<BR><I>It has been a inward-facing autumn for the allies of VLADISLAUS STRAUD. In a foreboding mansion in JAMAICA ESTATES sits the darkly-bricked STRAUD MANSION. Inside the house are sheltered three vampires. The evening has come, welcome.</I>

#### STRAUD

> I NEED TO TAKE A DELIVERY TO MARSCAPONE.

#### MANDARC

> MORE PLASMA PACKS?

<BR><I>There is a hint of dismissiveness in his voice but STRAUD dismisses it.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE HE'S REQUESTED A DROP-OFF.
>
> I CONSIDER IT AN OFFERING OF GOOD-WILL.

#### MANDARC

> LET ME COME WITH YOU.

#### STRAUD

> YOU'D LIKE AVAEL TO WATCH THE HOUSE?

#### MANDARC

> SHE'S MORE THAN CAPABLE.

<BR><I>KEVIN MARSCAPONE lives across the borough; to accomplish the requisite task requires the assistance of a car. MANDARC doesn't drive.</i>
