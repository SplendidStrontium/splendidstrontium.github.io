The inspiration was cantrips and low-level spells but it quickly spun out-of-focus. I wrote these on paper and just typed them up with minimal editing. Who knows how accurate they are, or if I'll change my mind about what certain characters can or cannot do. (have fun)

* WINDRAZER (FRIDAY PERKINS)
	* _Windrazer_ creates tiny disturbances of air that act as precise blades. These would not slice skin but are powerful enough to accurately cut spiderweb.
	
* WHISPERLIFT (FRIDAY PERKINS)
	* _Whisperlift_ creates a stable pillow of air to carry the most delicate of spiderwebs. The pillow can be summoned anywhere in visible(close) distance, but will fall as per the weight of the carried web. From here you may carry the pillow by hand.
	
* MOTHER'S TOUCH (FRIDAY PERKINS)
	* the third of her web-maintenance spells, this allows the caster to pick up a lifted web & adhere it to its new home with "mothersilk"
	
* DISPEL MEMORY (KEVIN MARSCAPONE)
	* if, and only if, Kevin has shared a subject's memory within the Dream/Haunt(Elysion?), he may "reset" the neurons, erasing that memory
	
* COLORIZER (KEVIN MARSCAPONE)
	* similar, but in the opposite direction of dispel mem., this can intensify a subject's memory of an event (permanently) or increase their retention of a current event
	
* SENSE (METAL) (STRAUD, followers)
	* metals buzz with a resonance -- Straud can hear it. Diff. metals make diff tones -- alloys&stone mixes make identification more difficult. He has been teaching this to others. Certain crystals, esp non-indigeneous data crystals, also vibrate gently.
	
* CATERWAUL (SVETLANA OBOROVSKY)
	* Svet can yowl with incredible volume to her feline followers simple commands -- come, scatter, hunt, rest, hide, ...
	
* CREATE ALLOY (MNDC, followers)
	* by manipulating the resonance of metals, one may encourage them to join in a regular pattern. Un-alloy is much more difficult ...
	
* ZERO SUM ONE (K. MARSCAPONE)
	* manipulate gambles, esp by swapping order of events. e.g. Kevin takes a 1/20 so Riker can roll 18/20. The more 'minor' the event, the more likely it is to look natural.
	
* MISREAD RUNE (K. MARSCAPONE)
	* turn belief into 'reality' -- a person sees their prediction as true. e.g. I think a coinflip is going to be tails so I see it as tails. Others around me also see tails. Kevin as well as any decent mage will see through the illusion.
	
* CALL WULFRIEND (MNDC)
	* similar to caterwaul but operates through the protected channels of the Dream
	
* COMPREHEND MACHINERY (MNDC)
	* With a touch, electrons travel through the device & create a 3D map in MNDC's consciousn. He can distinguish magical from non-magical objects as well as identify true&false microprocessors.
	
* TO DO CLUES (CEDRIC D'IGGORY)	
	* especially in anxious people who tend to repeat their thoughts, C' can hear their worries but esp. intentions. e.g. "Oh man. after I'm done working out I can't forget to go to the store to buy eggs&flour"
	
* DEBUGGIFY (CEDRIC D'IGGORY)
	* insects are chaotic (in behavior, despite order of hives) & trees are lawful. Cedric can protect a tree from insect predation -- tends to use music & tonal resonance
	
* DEBACTERIATE (MNDC)
	* by humming at certain frequencies, Mandarc can destroy bacteria harmful to 'noid livelihood
	
* WHISTLE WHILE YOU WORK (MNDC)
	* so long as you can maintain a whistle, ambient soaps, sponges, etc, will do their job
	
* BIG GREEN MEANIE/BEANY (AEGWAIN)
	* Aegwain has had a difficult time accepting her gift by gardening has helped. By spending time w/plants she can sense weeds, invasive specie, bugs, sickness, etc. She senses the flow of the system & corrects by mag or non-mag means.
	
* MOONBEAM (RINI)
	* Rini can use moonlight in any elven ritual that uses sunlight. She can also reflect & absorb the light (as in sunbathing)
	
* COMPREHEND WHIRLIGIG (JANEWAY)
	* Janeway can understand simple (no mag. no electr) machines by watching them work & superficial fiddling. This helps her maintain the AVAEL 'bot.
	
* ILLUMINATE GHAST (SEPAL)
	* Sepal's dinosaurs have been banished to the Haunt but no idea is truly forgot. She is able to create an illusion of any of her monsters -- a hologram of sorts, though she must maintain concentration
	
* SILENCE FLAME (CEDRIC D'IGGORY)
	* Cedric is able to stop a fire at will. Depending on the size of the fire, more time/concentration needed. Any dmg incurred will not be fixed
	
* EMPATHIZE (PLANT) (CEDRIC, KEVIN)
	* Upon successful touch, Cedric can sense a plant's mood, health, and sometimes even get a story. Like Aegwain's, but more powerful & Cedric speaks the lang. of plants natively -- Aegwain 'translates'
	
* REPAIRIO (FRIDAY PERKINS)
	* So long as Friday vaguely understands why an object is broken, she can attempt a repair. Since she doesn't natively understand microprocessors, the spell may fail on complex devices
	
* SCRUBEROO (KATY JANEWAY)
	* A general purpose cleaning spell, the dirt is displaced somewhere else
	
* DELISIOSO (KATY JANEWAY)
	* Janeway can summon food or make existing food edible. She is still unsure if the spell steals, creates, or remixes.
	
* BLINK (LISA EASTON)
	* Lisa can disappear & reappear a short distance away -- must visualize destination. Spell is somewhat disorienting/unpleasant to use. Smells of flowers & cut grass.
	
* MIST FORM (STRAUD & disciples)
	* Less purely water, the caster disappears in a cloud of jungle rain, with a lightly tarlike smell. The form is somewhat difficult to maintain & a location to rematerialize should be chosen quickly.
	
* BAT FORM (RINI, many 'Earth-native' elves)
	* As ERL had no moon, this form is common among the moon worshippers of Earth. Unlike other vampiric travel forms, this shapeshift can be maintained as long as desired.
	
* VAMPIRIC SPEED (KEVIN, MNDC, AVAEL)
	* A special long-distance lope Kevin learned from his father. He taught it to MNDC, who uses it almost exclusively of other travel options because of its lack of disorientation. AVAEL is able to imitate w/cyborg augments but it is mechanical, not a spell
	
* DIVINE REHABILITATION (TATANYA, CORDELIA)
	* Animals on Earth are more 'containers' for their divine sponsors than they are true animals. This spell repairs the body & rebinds the spirit of an 'animal'.
	
* MOON TIARA MAGIC (RINI)
	* A spell adapted from her mother, Rini can use this glowing tiara as a boomerang to bring any small object to herself. Weight is a concern; lighter objects are easier to steal & 10# is around the max for the tiara to grab
	
* MOON HEALING ESCALATION (RINI)
	* another from mother's spellbook, this spell can heal non-magical humanoids. She tends to use it to show off, primarily, and for doctoring second
	
* SKELE-SPEAK (MCCOY)
	* McCoy can set bones back in place just by asking nicely
	
* COMMAND LESSER BLUDFIEND (MCCOY)
	* By emitting carefully curated pheromones, McCoy can dominate the minds of vermin that seek blood (his favs are leeches & horseflies)
	
* CREATE VIROID (MCCOY)
	* McCoy may take a small amount of his body (non-renewable) to create a virus. He may specific(sic) what it targets & other details. Once created he cannot directly command it but he can destroy them 1 by 1 (again, he doesn't get back the starting material)
	
* MINI-MOON LOCKET (RINI)
	* Rini has a small 'locket' (it's actually a free-standing obj) that can project any hologram she can imagine. (omission) The hologram is only visible to children.
	
* SWEET LITTLE BIRDIE (SEPAL)
	* Sepal can force others to be hospitable by intensifying latent guilt. People around her feel bad for saying no to such a 'nice old lady'.
	
* BAD OL' PUTTY-TAT (SEPAL)
	* Granny has an intense dislike of mammals and enters a trance of rage repelling them
	
* DETECT ESPIONAGE (K. MARSCAPONE)
	* Kevin's father is a sort of spiritual guardian -- when an undesired watcher is watching, he gets an intense rise of the hair on his neck. A few sniffs, a slip of the eyes into the dream, and he's well on his way to punishing those that spy w/o permission, (works on electronics as well as magic devices)
	
* HYPNOTIZE (MNDC, STRAUD)
	* Mandarc loves singing & was ecstatic to meet the karaoke machine in his new realm. Straud has taught him many powerful songs to affect emotions & dampen their free will.
	
* TREKNOBABBLE (MNDC)
	* Mandarc can command a conversation such that the individual thinks they understand but are actually confused. This can result in distraction & memory loss.
	
* BIND METAL (STRAUD, disciples)
	* Non-vampires have trouble working with non-oxidized metals -- Straud has an entire discipline of techniques to retrieve rogue metals from the environment.
	
* DESPAIRIO (FRIDAY PERKINS)
	* When people talk to her, sometimes they see flashes of the Haunt, failed timelines that exist only in ideaspace. She is only recently learning to quiet this power
	
* INFATUATE (CHARLOTTE BRADFORD)
	* 'I can't make anyone fall in love" -the Genie // Well, Charlotte certainly tries.
	
* NECROCALL, DEDEATHIFY (TATANYA)
	* apparently Tatanya is not subject to the Genie's taboos. I'm OK with that.
	
* INFERNIATE (WEASLIE) 
	* The angrier he is, the better the spell works.
	
* ZIPZAP (POTTER)
	* The chosen Child of Lightning, Potter can quickly destroy electrical objects.
	
* PULL HEAT (HERMIONE)
	* Hermi can pull warmth from the ambient environment to herself. She has figured out how to use this to heat & it was instrumental in her resurrection of Cedric.
	
* TREKNOBABBLE (MNDC)
	* When an object (preferably non-magical, though it works for those too, just at slightly higher DC) is broken, if someone else is able to explain the problem to MNDC, he can come up with an appropriate solution
	
* CONSULT McGYVER (the 'Giver'?) (K. MARSCAPONE)
	* When K is attempting to repair an object by hand, he may 'phase out' his consciousness to see if his encyclopedic database can help out. ('you can never have too many bathrooms!')
	
* PING AETHER (STRAUD)
	* Straud can sense ether; 'the space between' as a fish in a tank can 'hear' where the water ends & glass begins. This helps him (with his exceptional hearing for tone&timbre) diagnose objects of ordinary or magical origin. It would help him diagnose a broken fan or wire in a computer but does nothing for software, or, say, a wizard's rune.
	
* I READ THE MANUAL (MNDC)
	* 'yes i can read your thoughts and i am smarter than you' Upon encountering unknown language, MNDC can break it down into logical subparts -- longer sections, repeated exposure, etc, helps
	
* COMPREHEND LANGUAGE (K. MARSCAPONE)
	* Any language/dialect K has encountered in the Dream/H he has a chance of understanding IRL. Speaking requires slightly higher DC.
	
* BEEN THERE, DONE THAT (STRAUD)
	* 'YOU'VE BEEN SO MANY PLACES, I GUESS IT MUST BE SO...'
	
* I SPEAK AMERIKAN (AVAEL EASTON)
	* AVAEL has lived in Amerrka since her birth -- she can understand & speak languages/dialects/pidgin that she has encountered in her travels. Usually tries to make ya laff but how funny can a 'bot git?
	
* TSAR'S LIBRARY CARD (SVETLANA O.)
	* E'r an avid reader, Svet can understand & speak modern & premodern Earth lang inc 'elven'
	
* DOCTOR'S ORDERS (MCCOY)
	* ten years bedrest, Captain, that's an order! McCoy can issue bodily commands to others with low WILL. Works much less often on people he personally knows.
	
* MED SCHOOL MUMBLES (MCCOY)
	* can bluff his way through a conversation with a stranger -- feigning associations or even trying to trick them into giving up a secret. Must speak common language.
	
* GOD IS DEAD / HE'S DEAD, JIM (MCCOY)
	* can use language of 'expertise' to convince another to change their belief [system]. i.e. vulcans have green blood & thus must be related to orcs thus are worthy of hate. Can also work on topical events esp where ppl would ostensibly trust his authority as a doctor
	
* THE BOY THAT LIVID (POTTER)
	* Years of emotional neglect have left the boy with an acute sense of justice -- upon witnessing such things, his anger can, e.g. pop lightbulbs, even start small fires
	
* EARTHSHAKE! (HERMI)
	* What once happened when she was anxious or afraid, she is learning to control
	
* SHARPTOOTH! (SEPAL)
	* her favorite travel form
	
* TOTO RECALL (SVETLANA O.)
	* As you may know, cats&dogs are ancient enemies from Firsthome. But true cats are near extinct & wolves are now almost exclusively in the Dream so the two are now allies against their foes. Svetl. despises a lack of competition -- upon sight of a broken wulf, she can send its soul back to the font from which it came. (LAZERZ)
	
* BRUSHY BRUSHY (SVETL)
	* fav spell of Bixbix, Xib, and Skittles. Quickly freshens the fur of a feline.
	
* FOXFIRE (SVETL)
	* her instinct to hunt can be sated somewhat by e-gaming tho bugs & errors are even more irritating. good thing she has elven meditation techniques~!
