COUNT STRAUD,

IT GOES DARKLY. THE WEATHER HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE BETTER BUT I FEAR FOR THE HEALTH OF THE TREE. I HAVE BROUGHT IT INDOORS ACCORDING TO YOUR SUGGESTION. IT IS STILL BUDDING AND I DO NOT WANT TO SPOIL THE PLANT BUT I WILL DO AS YOU SUGGEST. I STILL THINK THE OCCASIONAL EXPOSURE TO THE WINTER WINDS WILL DO IT WELL AND I PLAN ON PLACING IT OUTSIDE ON FAVORABLE NIGHTS.

THE EDGES OF THE LEAVES ARE SURPRISINGLY SEPARATED AND SERRATED. I DID NOT THINK THE ANCESTRY WOULD COME THROUGH IN SUCH A WAY GIVEN THE FOOD SOURCE OF THE PLANT. NEVER-THE-LESS, IT HAS FIRMLY DECIDED TO SHOW ITS MOTHER TREE. 

PLEASE PAY A VISIT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PROGRESS YOURSELF. I THINK THAT IF YOU SEE THE THING, YOU WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT THE PLANT CAN DO FOR US. IT WOULD BE A BOON TO US AND OUR KIND. I HOPE THAT IN TIME, YOU WILL COME TO SEE THE FUTURE AS I DO.

AT YOUR LEISURE, I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION ON THE PESTILENCE OF THE MID-FOURTEENTH CENTURY. I HAVE UNCOVERED SOME NEW RESEARCH ON WHICH I WOULD ENJOY YOUR COMMENTARY.

<BR>
