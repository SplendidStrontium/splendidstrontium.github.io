<br><i>THE SETTING is the SOO TOWNHOME, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK. THE YEAR is 1905. It has been unusually rainy this year. There have been occasional days of a humid heat, when the smell of the rivers seeps inland: an impolite plague.</i>

<i>MYRTLE SOO is a five-year-old girl. Her dense, raven locks are cut as if by scythe just underneath her jaw. She wears a clean, if plain, frock.</i>

<i>MYRTLE is playing jacks on the poured steps of her home, a vaguely Victorian brownstone.</i>

<i>In the distance can be heard the roar of an elevated train. The SOO TOWNHOME is a few small blocks from the railway.</i>

<i>MYRTLE stops her game and is fishing in her pocket when she hears footfall. She looks down to see a woman in a red-gold Oriental dress.</i>

<br><i>MYRTLE stops suddenly, her tongue thick in her throat. She is dumbstruck, as if choking on a bit of unchewed food.</i>

<i>The WOMAN IN THE RED DRESS pushes past the child and walks up the steps.</i>
