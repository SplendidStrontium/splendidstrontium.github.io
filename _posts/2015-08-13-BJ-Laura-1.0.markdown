# BJ Laura & Desco business website 1.0 completed

I deployed the first version of a brand new website for BJ Laura & Desco Services today, accessible at two urls:

*	[BJ Laura & Son][bjl]
*	[Desco Service][desco]

The website will direct customers to their business through phone, email, and google location services.  A history of the business is listed.  The rudiments of a sign-in system are in place.  SEO?

The graphics are placeholders for the most part.  Mobile, as well, still needs an overhaul.

Future versions may include a marketplace for materials and parts.

Currently researching best ways to incorporate transactions with existing Rails site.
