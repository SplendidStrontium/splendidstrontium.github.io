I have been writing TCE --

Chapter 10 (Soaked) --

"The truth is that some people endure reality," Davian spoke, seeming to look over his shoulders before he continued. "And others —"

"Make it."

Some of my enduring difficulties have been writing Davian going forward. As you know, or may know, the man who originally penned Davian is now deceased.

I recently made a playlist. Hell, I'll feel so bold as to link it here --

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe 
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLCdHLkdH2vGp5mfIAZvqBGqJLmHaQCHIi" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

<br>"I want more --"

And I felt so discouraged, when Davian --

"Hard to come by --" they said. "and harder to hold--"

I recently was released to winter break, from my travails. And I have been tasked to write, yes, an easy assignment I admit --

And yet, I've thrown myself into organizing, tabulating, stipulating, which documents should be preserved into perpetuity, and which should disappear into obscurity.

Once, some two years ago, I thought I should preserve the voice with help. Help from the spirits from beyond.

Yes, once, some two years ago, I thought I would revive the man who had gone. The man who had spoken, but had since been silenced. The one who would speak no more. And yes, once, he had spoken to Mandarc.

Yes, it is true that Book 0 primarily concerns Cedric's apprenticeship under the man Davian Winchester. (Yes, I renamed him.) And I have been struggling underneath this weight, this veritable burden, because, in part--

This is not how it originally happened.

No, in fact, this was not, in the original conception of FPMC, this is how Cedric originally came to learn of the magic he possessed. 

In truth it was quite different!

But maybe; maybe it was not so different.

I have chosen to modify the retelling, to tell it how it happened, how it didn't happen, and how it should have happened.

Or how it made the most sense of happening. 

43,236 words -- that's what Novelcrafter claims I've made. Barfed. Vomited upon the page.

Yes, Book 0: What Time Cannot Touch.

How I hate you! How I despise that I feel I must get through this telling, this re-telling, this re-re-telling before I can get to the things that really happened!

Oh, but--it all really happened.

The truth is that some people endure reality--

and some make it.

(I'm not gonna crack.)
