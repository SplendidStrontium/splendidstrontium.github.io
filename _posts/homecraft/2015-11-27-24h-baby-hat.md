## NOTES ##
this pattern was done in a variegated 100% cotton worsted weight yarn.  I chose cotton as it is low maintenance to clean and does not pill.  Acrylic is warm but pills too much after washing for the kind of cap I wanted.

## NEEDLES ##
I knit using a US 5, despite the package suggesting a US 7.  I knit loosely and wanted a tight stockinette stitch.

## CAST ON ##
64 stitches, fits an average 6m/o in my gauge.  If you alter it, make it divisible by eight (# of decrease columns).  Perhaps use a circular needle to cast on, then join and transfer to double-pointed needles.

## WORK (1) ##
first row after joining, knit every stitch.  This separates the rib from the edge, setting it straighter.  With row 2, start [k2,p2] rib and continue until ribbing is about 2" long; this was about 15 rounds.

## WORK (2) ##
change over to stockinette stitch and knit every row until piece measures 6" total.  Check for 16st each per 4 double pointed needles.

## REDUCE/DECREASES ##
decrease 8st(2 per needle) one round, and maintain stitches the next, making the pattern:

- [k2tog, k6]
- [k]
- [k2tog, k5]
- [k]
- [k2tog, k4]
[...]
- [k2tog, k1]
- [k]
- [k2tog]

leaving one stitch on each needle.

## FINISH ##
cut the working yarn 5" from piece.  Thread on to a tapestry needle and thread through remaining stitches, pull through.  Weave in ends.
