<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">With the spell outlined, I change into a long midnight blue suit with cream ascot and star sapphire pin. Though not currently in fashion, I complete the ensemble with a tophat and exquisite cane. Thus attired, I hop in my Rolls Royce Corniche convertible and head over to the Blue Velvet.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You encounter a fair bit of traffic while you drive from Manhattan to Astoria; a collision on the Queensboro Bridge has reduced throughput to a single lane. It's infuriating but there's nothing you can do short of vulgar magicks. There are few ways in which the Mortal realm controls any piece of your life and this is one of them. But you've left yourself enough time to reach the B.V. before nightfall -- You'd wanted to be Fashionable but not Late.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You finally drive up in front of the B.V. and pull your car into an empty space. You exit the car effortlessly, but place the cane nevertheless firmly on the ground. Doing a cursory sweep of the area, you are filled with energies from auras flowing past one another like clouds. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The most present aura is that of a valet who takes your keys and hands you a ticket. His aura is thin and hazy; you easily sense that he's what the vampires call a 'thinblood'. He would have no way to sense your aura -- he has not enough potential to work such feats -- but still seems to regard your dress and carriage as worthy of respect and avoids eye contact with you, seeming small as he bows his head and shows you his hair rather than his face.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You pocket the ticket and place your trust both in the valet and the extensive protective wards you have on your car. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sun threatening to set behind you, you finally walk into the Blue Velvet and drink in the feeling of the extranatural subsuming your presence. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To your left is a stage set with a large velvet curtain in faded scarlet. The curtain is heavy in silence while the whispers of those hidden behind it trickle through to your consciousness. The ample sitting areas include booths lining the walls with wood&iron tables filling the floorspace. There are still plenty of empty chairs but you suspect the same will not be true in an hour's time.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A barkeep is drying glasses and arranging them on a hidden shelf. The din of tens of conversations creates a viscous environment of conflicting sounds. Alone at the bar sits a man with dark hair faced away from you, leaving a few adjacent seats empty for other patrons. Straud is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As I take the ticket I palm him a Victoria Sovereign and make my way into the club without looking back.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"T-Thank you, sir. Have a good night!" He calls after you. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You noticed there were two seats at the valet's station but the second seat had been empty.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Making my way to the Bar, I take a seat one space away from the dark-haired man and order a Paloma.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Paloma, huh? Grapefruit's been popular this season. Never have the stuff myself, tastes terribly bitter to me. They say it runs in my blood."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The dark-haired main raises an eyebrow at the word.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You hear a shriek followed by a cacophony of tittering laughter come from behind the curtained stage. The interruption quickly dissipates but not without disturbing the young man to your left. He stares over at the stage expectantly but no commotion rises. The ambient noise rises again to its previous levels.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He grasps his glass tightly and downs the rest of the dark purple drink. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Barkeep. Another."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I find bitter more appealing as the years pass." I take a sip "Excellent. Refreshing and balanced".  I slide another coin across the counter. I notice the man's reaction and take the opportunity to look him over.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The man stiffens as if a cold breeze has drifted across his person. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Barkeep, did you hear me?" He's anxious, either at your observation, or something else. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yeah yeah I heard you. Keep your shorts on." The bartender's tone borders on caustic; it's obvious the man is a regular. A regular lush.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Show starts at eight-thirty?" The barkeep hums agreement. The dark-haired man looks down at his wristwatch. "About an hour to go..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The man gives a new meaning to the phrase cold shoulder. It is clear he worries that you're about to speak to him. He adjusts his glasses and feigns interest in a nearby television.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Suddenly you become aware of a familiar figure emerging from behind the closed curtain. A thin man with silver hair splits the divide between the two sides of the curtain and stands alone on stage, if only for a moment. He quickly surveys the crowd, takes a few steps forward, and gracefully jumps from the stage to the floor.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vlad!!" A young woman, part of a trio already having reserved their seat for the performance, calls out to him as he leaps from the stage. "Please let me introduce you to my friends."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The dark-haired man sitting next to you watches Straud descend and continues to observe with ire as he entertains the trio of mortals. Soon, the freshly prepared drink is gone with a swift gulp and he slams it to the countertop.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Please be gentle with the glasses, will ya?" the barkeep speaks aloud in impatience.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Observing the young ladies swarming Straud, I raise my class and meet his eye with a sly grin then turn back around to the bar. "Another, please." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">While my drink is being made I make a show of inspecting the room, taking care not to look directly at the man next to me. (It is not my intention to freak him out or make him uncomfortable).</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud tips his head to you and turns his attention back to the young ladies. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The bartender politely accepts your order and begins preparing the drink. To your distinct pleasure, you notice that the bar has fresh fruit from which he draws the source of your drink. Grapefruit is only one of the offerings; there are lemons and limes, some small apricots and plums, and judging by the garnish on one of the drinks he's preparing, even strawberries. Someone else receives a generous stalk of celery in a bloody mary.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The man at the bar whips out his phone, reads his text messages, and starts mumbling at the screen. You can hear him fairly easily due to your heightened senses. "I'm not coming tonight, what part of that is so difficult to understand?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You inspect the room and</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A huge crowd clamors at the door, having to rearrange into single-file to fit through the door. There must be fifteen people there, you estimate. Judging by their attire, it's a fraternity function. The fraternity appears mixed-sex. They file through the door and fill up most of the booths in the audience.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud bids the trio adieu and approaches you as the fraternity crowds in.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian -- Davian Hughes. It's a delight to see you tonight. I trust you've met my assistant?" He motions toward the anxious man, who's sitting hunched over his glass as if protecting it from ceiling debris. His shoulders slowly roll back as he hesitates to join the conversation.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Mandarc." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But Straud will have none of the audacious play at rudeness. "Davian is an old friend of mine. Please do me the honor of introducing yourself properly. This reluctant approach does not suit you."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He turns around and finally faces you. He is wearing a drab grey coat with a fur-lined collar. His eyes are a steely grey such that his dilated pupils almost disappear into the abyss. His black hair is slicked back with a light gloss of some kind of pomade.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Mandarc Soo." he reaches out his hand to request a handshake.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud resumes the conversation. "I am sorry you have not had the pleasure of meeting with Mandarc. He's only been under my charge a few short years. Are you planning on staying for the performance, Mandarc?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I wanted to make sure you had help if you needed it." Mandarc straightens his jacket and stands.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I was sure you would be otherwise occupied this evening."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Just idle chit-chat, Master. Nothing there matters in the grand scheme of things."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I shake his hand and give him a warm smile, ignoring the chill of his grip. "Pleasure to meet you." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Turning back to Straud I make a small gesture encompassing the room "Going to be a packed house; I do hope you've hired a magician."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">"More than I've expected, but fewer than I planned for."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Pulling rabbits out of hats always gets the activists in a tizzy. Besides which, the hedge wizards always ask for too much compensation for what they're willing to offer."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"How was your visit with the Marscapones?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc inserts himself into the conversation. "You were visiting with the Marscapones?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud maintains a calm demeanor and informs him, "Why yes, Mandarc. Surely you've remembered that it's been precisely one year since the death of the Matron."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc's eyes widen in surprise. "One year?! Has it really been a year?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The Marscapones are well; I left flowers at the memorial as requested; Irises."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Kevin is an odd duck, but provided stimulating conversation".</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Turning to Mandarc, I nod in agreement: "Sed fugit interea, fugit inreparabile tempus"</p>
