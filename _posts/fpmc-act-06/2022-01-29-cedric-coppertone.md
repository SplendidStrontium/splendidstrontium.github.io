### // ZHOU HOUSE //

<BR><I>Cedric had paid one more visit to the Zhou family since the birth of his kittens. Today, his heart was not in it.</i>

#### SEVEN

> CAN YOU FIGURE ANY REASON WHY YOU'RE ABLE TO GO OUT DURING THE DAY?

#### CEDRIC

> EXCUSE ME?
> 
> NEXT QUESTION PLEASE.

#### SEVEN

> JUST, IT SEEMS YOU SPECCED INTO IMPROVED SUN RESIST.

#### CEDRIC 

> WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? 

#### SEVEN

> YOU DON'T SQUINT.

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T SQUINT.

#### SEVEN 

> YEAH, YOU DON'T SQUINT. YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE. 

#### CEDRIC 

> I USE A PROPRIETARY HIGH SPF SUNSCREEN. 

#### SEVEN 

> OH, SOUNDS NICE. 

#### CEDRIC 

> I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT; IT'S NOT JUST STUFF YOU CAN BUY OFF THE SHELF. 
> 
> I HAVE A SPECIAL SOURCE.

#### SEVEN 

> OH. OKAY.
> 
> I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

<BR><I>She looks at her hands anxiously and then decides to apologize for her previous indiscretion.</i>

#### SEVEN 

> SORRY ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY. I'VE BEEN PLAYING TOO MANY VIDEO GAMES LATELY.

#### CEDRIC 

> I JUST DON'T WANT YOU THINKING YOU CAN SLATHER UP IN SOME COPPERTONE AND TAKE A DUNK IN THE POOL.

#### SEVEN 

> OH, I WON'T.

<BR><I>There is a heavy pause in the conversation.</i>

#### SEVEN 

> SO, IT'S A SPECIAL CREAM?

#### CEDRIC 

> I WOULDN'T MENTION IT TO YOUR SISTERS THOUGH.
> 
> I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF MY GUY CAN MAKE ENOUGH FOR YOU AND THEM TOO.

#### SEVEN 

> GOT IT.
> 
> SOUNDS NICE THOUGH.

#### CEDRIC 

> I MEAN, I'LL LOOK INTO IT.
> 
> BUT NO GUARANTEES.

#### SEVEN 

> DO YOU THINK IT WAS TRUE, THAT DRACULA COULD GO OUTSIDE DURING THE DAY?
> 
> I THINK THE BOOK MAKES IT A BIT AMBIGUOUS.
> 
> ALTHOUGH ANNE RICE MAKES IT A HARD AND FAST RULE.

#### CEDRIC 

> ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE SUNRISE WILL KILL HIM?

#### SEVEN 

> NOW, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN BRAM STOKER. IT DOES HAPPEN IN FILMS THOUGH. LIKE THE 1922 AND 1979 NOSFERATU. 
> 
> BUT I FEEL LIKE EVEN THAT ONE IS AMBIGUOUS ABOUT IF HE CAN GO OUT AT DAY, JUST SPECIFICALLY IF HE'S EXPOSED TO THE SUNBEAMS AT SUNRISE.
> 
> OR MAYBE MORE RESTRICTIVELY, HE MUST BE SLEEPING AT THE SUNRISE.

#### CEDRIC 

> IT'S A CURSE OF SLEEPLESSNESS.

#### SEVEN 

> WHAT?

#### CEDRIC 

> YOU EVER HEARD OF TORTURE CHAMBERS WHERE IT'S AN ENDLESS ROOM OF LIGHT? THAT THEY NEVER TURN OFF THE LIGHTS FOR SIMULATION OF A DIURNAL SLEEP SCHEDULE. IT'S A TORTURE TACTIC.

#### SEVEN 

> I...UH...DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

#### CEDRIC 

> THE VAMPIRE'S DEPENDENCE ON SLEEP IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT REMINDS HIM OF HIS MORTALITY. 
> 
> IT'S THE LOSS OF SLEEP THAT ACCOMPANIES THE DESCENT THAT IS PART OF WHAT DRIVES THE VAMPIRE INSANE.
> 
> THAT FINAL FALL IS NEVER TRULY SURVIVED.
> 
> THE DAMNED ARE JUST THAT. MIGHT AS WELL SETTLE IN FOR THE FINAL NIGHT.

#### SEVEN 

> IT ALSO MAKES HIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE OPT-IN, SO THAT HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW A VERY SPECIFIC RULE IN ORDER FOR HIM TO CONTINUE TO EXIST TIMELESS IN A TIMED SPHERE.
> 
> IT MAKES YOU WONDER, WHY RISK IT?
> 
> THIS ISN'T SOME MARIE CURIE THING.
> 
> OR MAYBE IT KIND OF IS.

#### CEDRIC 

> SHE DIED IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE, NOT RISKING A KEY TENANT OF THE FAITH.

#### SEVEN 

> FAITH IN THE CULT OF DRACULA?

#### CEDRIC 

> YEAH, I GUESS.

#### SEVEN

> BUT IN THE 1931, HE DIES DUE TO A STAKE IN THE HEART.
> 
> THE SUNRISE IS THE WEAKNESS OF THE NOSFERATU.

#### CEDRIC 

> THEN HE DIES IN THE MOST HUMAN WAY POSSIBLE, NOT DUE TO MAGIC, BUT AN ORDINARY DEATH THAT WOULD KILL ORDINARY MEN.
> 
> CURSE OF SLEEPLESSNESS, CURSE OF SLEEPFULNESS...BOTH ARE CURSES AND CAUSE SOME KIND OF NEGATIVE EFFECT ON YOUR CHARACTER.
> 
> AND REALLY THE CURSE OF SLEEPLESSNESS IS JUST A SUBSET OF SLEEPFULNESS BECAUSE ALL LIVING THINGS NEED REST.
> 
> EVEN IF IT'S NOT LAY STILL IN A BED UNCONSCIOUS FOR EIGHT HOURS AT TWILIGHT. 
> 
> ALL LIVING THINGS NEED REST.

#### SEVEN 

> AND MY SISTERS CHIDE ME FOR GETTING MY Z'S WHEN I CAN.
> 
> BUT IT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION, WHY ARE WE DIFFERENT?

#### CEDRIC 

> MYTH BECOMES LEGEND. 
> 
> IT WAS NEVER TRUE IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT NO ONE HAD YET RISKED IT.
> 
> OR TIMES, THEY BE A CHANGING.

#### SEVEN 

> YOU THINK WE LIVE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE OF AGES?

#### CEDRIC 

> I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.
