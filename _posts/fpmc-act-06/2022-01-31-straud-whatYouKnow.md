### // STRAUD MANSION //

<br><i>I truly got mixed up with the Marscapones in an event that was not lost to the Hexfiles.</i>

<i>The year was 1995.</i>

#### MANDARC

> HOW DID YOU MEET VINCENT?

#### STRAUD

> THE FIRST TIME?
> 
> I'M NOT SURE I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME ANYMORE.
> 
> BUT THAT TIME HE WANTED HELP RETREIVING HIS SON FROM TRELAINE.

#### MANDARC

> YEAH, YOU WERE SOMETHING OF A LEGEND AROUND THE LAB.
> 
> MOST DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT THOUGH. ESPECIALLY NOT WITH ME AROUND.
> 
> BUT I GATHERED THERE WERE EXPLOSIVES INVOLVED.

#### STRAUD

> I CALLED IN OLD FAVORS OWED.

#### MANDARC

> SWEET.
> 
> YEAH, IT WAS CONNECTED WITH A LARGE INCREASE OF SECURITY AT THE LAB.

#### STRAUD

> IT IS NOT A COURSE OF ACTION I'D OFTEN TAKE.

#### MANDARC

> IT WAS QUARQ, WASN'T IT?
> 
> HE'S SUCH A BELIEVER.

#### STRAUD

> VINCENT WAS HIBERNATING A LOT IN THOSE DAYS.
> 
> IT REQUIRED GREAT ENERGY TO DO WHAT HE DID.
> 
> YOU ARE YOUNG, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO HAVE TO EXERT YOURSELF IN SUCH A WAY.
> 
> BUT FOR VINCENT, ONE OF THE OLD ONES, IT WAS TRULY A FEAT TO BEHOLD.

#### MANDARC

> WERE YOU THERE?

#### STRAUD

> NOT THEN, IN 1995, NO. I WASN'T THERE. 
> 
> IT WAS HIS FIGHT.
> 
> BUT I LED HIM RIGHT TO HIS DOORSTOP.

#### MANDARC

> DID KEV TRULY HAVE THE TEETH?

#### STRAUD

> IN SOME RETELLINGS.

#### MANDARC

> WHY DID CEDRIC SPOOF IN HIS APPEARANCE TO THE GOTH KID?

#### STRAUD

> HE WISHED HE'D BEEN THERE AND THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE FOR AN EASIER LIE, SHOULD THE TIME COME.
> 
> HE WAS PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
> 
> I DON'T FAULT HIM FOR IT.

#### MANDARC

> YOU DON'T FAULT HIM FOR MUCH.

#### STRAUD

> EXCUSE ME?

#### MANDARC

> YOU DELIVERED THE ZHOU FAMILY TO HIM ON A SILVER PLATTER.

#### STRAUD

> AND YET HE'S ATTEMPTING TO SHIRK HIS DUTIES.

#### MANDARC

> NO ~

#### STRAUD

> DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO BY ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH MARSCAPONE?
> 
> I FIND THE WHOLE ESCAPADE TO BE A COLLOSAL WASTE OF TIME.

#### MANDARC

> I'VE BEEN THINKING, MASTER.
> 
> WHAT IF THERE'S MORE TO OUR VICTORY THAN ELIMINATING OUR ENEMIES? WHAT IF THERE'S ALSO WINNING THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE?
> 
> IF THE REVEAL IS TRULY ON ITS WAY THEN IT FALLS TO US TO BE PREPARED.
> 
> I WANT TO BE STANDING UPRIGHT AMONG THE FALLEN MASSES.
> 
> I WANT TO BE THERE TO LEAD OUR PEOPLE TO VICTORY AND PEACE.
> 
> IF I AM THERE STANDING AS A BEACON OF GOODNESS, I WILL BE PRIMED TO BE A FIGURE OF DIPLOMACY.

#### STRAUD

> IT'S GOOD ENOUGH IN THEORY BUT CAN YOU ACTUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH?
> 
> THE RISKS ARE HIGH.
> 
> YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TRUST THE EVERY DAY STAN.
> 
> AND MARSCAPONE IS ALREADY ON YELLOW ALERT.

#### MANDARC

> YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT EMMITT HERE IF YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE HE'D BE SAFE.
> 
> WE'LL GO THROUGH SAFE CHANNELS.

#### STRAUD

> YOU THINK THERE ARE SAFE CHANNELS?

#### MANDARC

> I HAVE FAITH.
