<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Through cyberspace comes a message intended for Davian. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hi Davian, it's Stephanie from the coffee shop. Are we still on for your party tomorrow?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hi Stephanie, yes, 78 Perry. Starting time is officially 7pm but feel free to arrive a little earlier if you and Veronica want a tour of the house ðŸ˜‰ - Davian"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"That would be wonderful!! See you a little after six, then. Looking forward to it!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In the stillness of the early morning, Davian is awoken by the sound of his cellphone playing 'Prodigal Son' by the Rolling Stones. Blearily he looks at the clock: 2:30am. This kid.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I reach over and grasp the phone, take a deep breath, then answer:</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hello Adam."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/00-050.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ADAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Good Morning Dad! How are things in NY?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Don't call me that. Things are busy, but good. Just learned of a new mission."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/00-050.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ADAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ooo. You'll have to tell me all about it, I'm going to be passing through town on my way to check out the Oriole migration. Should arrive late tomorrow, er, late today rather".</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hmm. I'm sure that's the only reason. Well, you are welcome, as always. There is space in the garage for Gloria. I am throwing a party on Friday, I expect you will attend. See you tomorrow. (a pause). Glad you're stopping by."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/00-050.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ADAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Sounds wonderful, knowing you I won't suffer for lack of 'bird' watching. See you tomorrow, Dad." (Click).</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Never quite getting back to sleep, Davian wakes up in the early hours of Friday to prepare his house for the party. A number of the auxiliary rooms have been changed to contain portals to distant locations; one such portal, for example, transports the entrant to a beautiful island in the South Pacific. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The process is time-consuming but worth the effort. By the time afternoon tea rolls around, Davian has just finished his rituals and finally has a moment to collect his breath before the guests start arriving.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian spends the remaining hour making sure the food is all laid out, the bar stocked, house ready, the right doors locked...etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At just shy of six o'clock in the evening, a knock comes to the door at 78 Perry. It is Stephanie and Veronica.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I open the door, smiling invitingly. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ladies, welcome to my home."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Would you care for a drink?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie takes this opportunity to speak for both women. "A drink would be wonderful, thank you so much for having us." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They both step into the house and are immediately impressed by the highly polished woodwork in the entry, and indeed, throughout the entire house. It doesn't seem that any surface has been forgotten in the preparation.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So, Davian -- your house is beautiful. I'm honestly stunned. What is it exactly that you do?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica taps her arm hastily, and whispers, though it's impossible to avoid Davian's earshot. "You can't just ask him that!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Walking over to the bar, I busy myself in making a couple of Cosmopolitans, along with an old fashioned for myself. Upon hearing the exchange between the two ladies, I can't help but smile, which is still on my lips as I hand them their drinks.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Oh, I'm a wizard."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica gives a pained expression but says nothing. Her eyes crawl around the finely festooned bar. It's not that she doesn't believe you, exactly, but perhaps there is just too much information for her to process right now. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie tries to avoid doing a double-take. Her very white teeth stand out against her lipstick. "A...A wizard?" She looks around at the finery. "Well, you do have a nice place." She takes it as an attempt at humor but the tone doesn't seem quite right for that. "Can you do any tricks?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Her companion sits at the bar hesitantly. Her expression is flat and uncertain.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I bark out a laugh. "Not a magician. There is no 'pick a card' stuff..., more like this":</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">With a quick gesture, I modify the atmosphere in the room, precipitating snow to fall gently around the two women.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie looks about wide-eyed, mouthing but unable to muster a "Wow!" utterance, but Veronica is not having such a good time. She, too, looks about the room in amazement, but seems distraught and anxious about what she's seeing.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She says in a low tone, "What did you put in those drinks?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I look at her a touch sadly. "Nothing at all my dear, besides the standard ingredients. This is not some hallucination, nor have you been otherwise drugged. If you don't believe me, the bathroom is right over there. Take a few moments, I promise you that it will be quite ordinary."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I must apologize for the abruptness of my revelation, a fancy took me when you asked and I thought it might be amusing to cavalier in my reply...but the truth is that I am indeed a mage, someone who can use magick. I wanted to prepare you, as my guests this evening will mostly be of the supernatural variety".</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica gets up from the barstool, a slight bit unsteady in her rise. The words he says make sense, and his conviction seems real... But she has been taken off-guard.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Maybe I'll just powder my nose for a moment then." And she disappears into the bathroom. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie watches as her companion almost limps off to the bathroom. She waits until just the two of them are alone in the room and then decides to speak quietly.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I've never..." but words escape her. They sit alone in quiet a moment. "I've never known that magic was real."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She tries to believe but it will take some time for the revelation to truly set in. "I'm sorry about Veronica... She's a bit stand-offish on the best of days. Cautious, I would like to say. But she's a good person."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"There are going to be more like you?" She smiles demurely. "If not tricks, then magic. I'd like to see more magic."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It's a lot to take in all at once...you are doing an amazing job, actually" I flash her a smile and briefly touch her shoulder in reassurance. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A few of those coming will also be mages, though there will also be...perhaps you should take another sip of your drink...that's better...vampires and at least 1 werewolf."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vampires and a werewolf?!"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What in heaven's name encouraged you --" And then a sinking feeling of dread brings a white curtain to her face. Her eyes dilate in fear. She thinks she's the prey.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You won't...let them...feed, will you?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I look her directly in the eyes and speak firmly and with (honest) conviction: "No. You are in no danger from them while you are my guest."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Taking a step back, I take a sip of my drink and continue reflectively. "My, I am making a mess of this...listen, I enjoyed our flirtation in the coffee shop and thought it might be fun to invite you to the party. You won't be the only mortal here, but the others have had time to come to terms with the fact that the reality of things is very different from what you have been raised to believe".</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It was not my intention to frighten you, though it seems I have done a good job of it...take all the time you need, I promise to answer any questions you have completely and honestly."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I conjure a chair for her to sit on while she collects herself.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I also dispel the snow, which is making a sizable drift in the foyer</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Are you the only...uh...wizard?" But she stumbles over her thoughts, clearly in some sort of startled stream-of-consciousness. "No, you couldn't be the only wizard, you just said you've invited more to the party." She looks around, the exquisitely maintained woodwork seeming suddenly the most comforting, ordinary thing she could see. Its gleam reflected light, and light was good.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You can...do anything you want? Whenever you want? That's...crazy."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She sits in silence on the chair and begins to twirl a strand of blonde hair, a nervous tic. She tries to say something a few times, but thinks better of it, and simply looks around herself.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica emerges from the bathroom. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You claimed we're safe from them; they're just other aspects of the world, as are you...?" Her words have the serenity of being plucked from her front-brain while hiding in the bathroom, but still seem to stutter about uncertain. "This is all too crazy."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie speaks, "Wizards, vampires, werewolves, all here in New York City? Are you the ringleader?" Maybe, she thought, her original conception of him was not too far off-base.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It might be accurate to call me 'a' ringleader. Without being too arrogant, I am one of the more accomplished mages known to live in NYC, but there are enough to call it a community. Up until recently, there was even a little magic school." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I conjure another chair for Veronica</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"As for 'doing whatever I want, whenever' I could, just like Ian Dusk could buy Instagram, but there are always consequences. In most cases, those consequences are enough to rein in the use of magic outside of protected areas such as my house".</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I can't believe...Such information has remained secret for all this time...Was Merlin real? Dracula? The Wolf-Man...?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She laughs lightly, for the first time in the serious discussion. "I'm sorry, I'm a blogger. I ask questions. It's what I do."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica takes the chair. "I can't believe you chose us. You chose us..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A knock comes on the door, interrupting their conversation.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Merlin...definitely, I have read some of his work. Dracula, I'm not the one to ask, but I believe so...at least, there is a Kindred (that's the term they prefer) who was the source of inspiration for that story. As for the last...there are many Shifters, though they probably dislike their portrayal in the Media...they do have anger issues, but don't turn into mindless monsters when they shift." My ramblings are interrupted by the knock. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A moment please ladies, feel free to help yourself at the bar, or to any of the food."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I open the door with slightly more force than is necessary. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hello, how can I help you?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian, hello, I know we're a bit early but given your guestlist, I thought it a good idea to make sure your bar was well-stocked." It's Cedric, along with a brown-haired man you don't recognize.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric raises his hands and bows slightly. "This is my friend Caleb Vatore and he'll be providing the goods tonight." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb looks rather effete in his dark eyeliner, posh haircut, and a single feather earring. He carries a large backpack that you assume is bulging with fruit. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"All locally-own, grown, and flown."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ah, Cedric. Good to see you again; Caleb, nice to meet you, and thank you for bringing samples to the party...come in. Two other guests have arrived, and perhaps you can help me with something...".</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I usher the two into the house, making sure to step over the snowdrift. "You can put the fruit behind any of the bars, I will ensure they are divided equally." (How do Veronica and Stephanie look?)</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric and Caleb enter the house somewhat cautiously, surprised to see the snow littering the floor. They round the corner and see, to their genuine surprise, two mortals seated in chairs in the middle of the floor, facing toward the row of barstools. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb goes behind the bar to begin unloading the fruit, while the blond vampire approaches the two startled women.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It would be rude to go without introduction, particularly on this night of festivities, so Cedric is the first to speak. "Hello, I'm Cedric." He thrusts his hand out toward Stephanie. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hello, Cedric. My name is Stephanie and this is my friend Veronica." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb watches carefully as Cedric greets the two women and tries to set them at ease. He was aware of a glamour that Cedric passively invoked; mortals did not notice his piercing cyan eyes. They did, however, appear to notice his scar, and followed it down the length of his face.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Pleased to meet you." Veronica seems to be beginning to calm down a little and reaches her hand out to meet Cedric's. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb, not wanting to be completely left out, awkwardly announces his own name and waves before returning to inspecting his store of fruit to ensure against bumps and bruises.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric feigns interest in a painting and faces away from the girls for a moment before turning back to begin what felt like necessary small-talk. "So how do you two know Davian?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The women look at each other quizzically before looking toward Davian, desperate for him to alleviate their feelings of confusion. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Stephanie and Veronica are personal friends, I met them recently while visiting the Marscapones. Shortly before you came to visit, in fact."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ladies, Cedric is an associate of a good friend of mine who you will meet later, Count Straud. Straud is the owner of the Blue Velvet nightclub."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"C-Count? Oy vey." Veronica seemed to be trying to fight her trembling with a dose of humor, or at least a nervous attempt at it.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric still feigned interest in the painting, but tears himself away a moment to throw a dubious look at Davian. His look has a hint of mischief and amusement you'd not seen the other day. It seems to say, "what's up with these two chickadees?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Before anyone else can notice the thrown look, he softens his expression and responds to the young woman's inquiry. "It's an old title but once landed, always landed. He's coming later, as is Kevin, as are a number of our friends. You've got quite the guestlist here, Davian."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So what's the cause for your party after all? Celebrating the death of the old broad?" He is flippant, but still strangely reverent. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb has just about finished his task. "Myrtle Marscapone?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes, Myrtle Marscapone. It was last year at about this time that she got into the duel with Agnes. I wish I'd been here to finish her off." Cedric has a confident tone such that you're not sure of which old woman he's speaking of.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Kevin was out with you and Mandarc, right?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yep, it was just George Henry alone at the Magicademy and he wasn't going to be able to stand up to a witch, let alone two fighting with fire."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Sigh</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I speak into Cedric's mind: <i>Honestly? I picked up these two as props for the party, perhaps some afterhours fun, but I ended up giving them a crash course on the Supernatural. They are still adjusting, so please be nice</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric, well-accustomed to these sorts of mental interruptions from his time with Vlad, listens patiently to the voice in his mind before responding in turn. <i>"So... aftershock. Got it."</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>"Let's get them some coffee. Maybe that's what they need after being thrown into a cold pool."</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>"I'm not sure Caleb realizes..."</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And while they're conversing, Caleb, none-the-wiser, speaks to the ladies from behind the counter. "So how do you two keep your days busy?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie speaks first. "I'm a blogger, fashioning myself a bit of a free-agent journalist. I won't say a word to anyone, though."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She leaves a pause in the conversation for her friend, who is slowly coming back to normal. "I'm a paralegal." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A solid wooden table appears, covered in coffee essentia</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/chiasa.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CHIASA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Hearing the commotion upstairs, Chiasa is moved to investigate. <i>Dav said the party was't for another half-hour...</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I open the door from the basement and am slightly surprised to see the crowd forming. Recovering quickly, I analyze the guests before they have a chance to notice my arrival. <i>Hmm, two floozies, a thinblood, and...what kind of Kindred is he?</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>"I'm not sure Caleb realizes..."</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Shaking my head to make my hair shimmer, I grasp Davian's arm in a familiar gesture while turning to look at the two ladies:</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian, you didn't tell me you were having people over early? Please introduce me to your guests" </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric is shocked to see the appearance of a ravishingly beautiful woman from Nihon. She slinks into the room as if on air and embraces Davian in a friendly hold. Cedric sends a diplomatic look her way. "I'm Cedric. This is Caleb, my business associate. He's providing some of the refreshments tonight." Caleb smiles slightly and waves.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm Stephanie, and this is my friend Veronica." A chilly wind seems to have blown across the room as the women recognize their shared connection. The girls try to seem confident, but the supernaturals in the room know how deflated the pair truly is.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/chiasa.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CHIASA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Cedric,...Dav mentioned your visit. Nice to meet you. And Caleb, you are his friend with the 'special fruit' i'm looking forward to trying one of those...Plasma Janes? I get so thirsty after waking up" (The last line is spoken while looking at Stephanie and Veronica rather than Caleb)</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">After a lingering pause Chiasa walks over and offers Stephanie her hand: "Nice to meet you Stephanie, and you Veronica; I'm Chiasa".</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Chiasa...Nice to meet you." After seeing Stephanie speak with such calm, Veronica pipes up. "Nice to meet you too." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The pair seem downright ordinary against Chiasa's effortless pink ombre. Stephanie looks toward Davian, but the emergence of Chiasa into the room has completely changed the ambiance.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Happy to oblige, ma'am." Caleb removes some tools he'd placed underneath the bar and begins to juice the ripe fruit. He doesn't bother offering anything to anyone else; it seems, for one reason or another, no one else should be interested in a plasma jane.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That should change when more guests arrive, Caleb thinks to himself.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We have the moon to thank for the plasma fruit. A moon that's quickly nearing her renewal." He tries to speak carefully as he separates pulp from juice.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Now, now Caleb. Let's not get racy in here."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What are you talking about, Cedric?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric makes a show of pretending he's going to whisper to Chiasa, but instead speaks using a normal volume. "Caleb's in love with a self-styled moon priestess."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb temporarily lowers his hands and sets the implements down on the bar's counter. "What, you want to make something of it?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Gentlemen, please, we have not consumed enough intoxicants to start fighting over women" (pointed look at Chiasa). "Besides, this is my house and therefore my rules. Unless you two wish to engage in Certamen, let's remember we are all friends here".</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I check my pocketwatch, "Hmm. We are approaching 7pm. Ladies, will you please join Chiasa and Caleb at the bar? I must dispense with your chairs and the coffee."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To Chiasa <i>You little Minx, that was not nice. Try to be kind to the muggles, eh?</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To Cedric: <i>Is this you (shares memory of teenage Cedric) </i></p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric feels the momentary pause of shame as his mind is filled with that brown-haired youth. The hair had changed mere moments after he had. It was the hallmark of a time long gone. But when he gazed into the mirror, all he saw was a memory of a boy afraid. Though the face was long dead, it would haunt him for time immemorial.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He seems to shiver as he comes to. Caleb is looking at him crooked, and Davian exudes pure smarm and confidence.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He looks at the mortals and feels a twinge of the thirst, but he shakes free of the compulsion.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The glass plunks down on the counter. "All ready, Chiasa." Caleb tries to shake off the rage at Cedric about Trente.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The mortals peer into the glass and wonder idly about its contents. They both take notice of the lack of ice. </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric to Davian: <i>Thanks.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb removes a second fruit and begins to prepare a plasma jane for himself. "Thank you. The orchard was a gift from my father who cultivated the fruit to grow here in our local soil. What I brought today I harvested just yesterday. It's best when it's fresh." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"My father thought the fruit would be a way for our kind to exist without preying on -- " and here he turns to Veronica, "your kind." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I like to think of the world as a delicate ecosystem where all things exist in balance. Too long has our kind preyed on theirs. I offer a way out."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The mortals continue to listen spout off tales about his father and his trials getting the fruit to finally grow in America. He has a number of them, and it fills the time.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"If you treat the fruit like rancid produce, that's all you'll get. Many think the pit is useless but you can use it to clean your fangs and if you pulverize it, the powder can be used as an insect deterent or even a piney deodorant."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric has stood by patiently, trying to affect civility, while Caleb schmoozes with the young women. When he starts talking about the uses of powdered plasma fruit pit, his patience begins to wear thin. But there seems to be no reason to scare the guests, not this early in the night. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Reluctantly, he admits that Caleb may have the proper, delicate approach.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He splits the two mortals and leans over the bar. "So what kind of monsters did you two believe in as children? Perhaps I can help put your minds at ease." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Stephanie speaks up first. "I believed in Santa until I was far too old for it."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I've never met him, but should he exist, he's a mage with facility over the spheres of time, forces, matter -- "</p>

<p class="ppl-sez"><i>He looks stressed. More than just fatigue.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I look down at his hand and return the smile, then rush forward and embrace him in a big bear hug. He stiffens, then relaxes, returns the embrace, and starts to laugh. </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric's aura is clearly vampiric from its pale hue but otherwise the color is somewhat difficult to place. Your first inclination is a light blue, but on second look it may be yellow or white. It's bright but very pale. At any rate, the man is calm and seemingly harmless.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric's cellphone dings but he shovels it away, still in the midst of the greeting ritual.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Come on in, I'll see if Caleb won't mix you up something nice. What do you drink?" </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric finishes penning a text message and slips the phone back into his pocket and reenters the buzz of the sitting room.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica speaks up in the quiet of the room. "Could I have a vodka gimlet, Caleb?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Of course."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>(Such a charmer, Caleb. Be careful or you might catch yourself trying to get a glimpse of their exposed neck.)</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric slips over toward you and you notice he employs just the smallest hint of vampiric speed. He speaks to you covertly, hoping his voice will be drowned in Caleb's chatter.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm glad you're sympathetic to our cause, it's more than I can say for most of your kind. But it still stands that ours is not a forward-facing mission. We are not meant to be orphan matrons. We will keep watch at the fence but I will not do well stewarding over children and their coloring books."</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At the door is a pale young man with jet-black hair. As soon as he sees you, he breaks out into a diatribe. "Did you know parking in your neighborhood is atrocious? We drove around for twenty minutes before finally settling on a garage. The Master was not happy about leaving his car in the care of some random mortals."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thanks for having us." Mandarc looks over his shoulder at Straud and Ben, just now approaching the stairs into the apartment.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud bows his head to Davian as he ascends the stairs and enters the residence. "Yes, thank you, Davian. It is good to be gathered together."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He gestures toward the third member of their party. "Davian, this is Askuwheteau, a dear friend of mine. He has traveled over a sizable distance and I thought he might enjoy your soiree this evening. I hope I have not tread on your hospitality by inviting him."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc rushes into the sitting room where he spies Caleb and Chiasa at the bar and Cedric leaning up against a wall with his arms crossed, looking sulky as usual.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He forms his hands into the shape of a gun and clicks toward Cedric in greeting. "'Ey, Chief." Cedric nods back toward him wordlessly and watches as Mandarc approaches the bar. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Can you throw one of those my way, Caleb? I'm parched. Drivin' the boss all the way here... Traffic was awful, parking was awful; I hate driving."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc has made little notice of the mortals outside of noticing the seats were occupied. He continues to ramble excitedly about the happenings of the drive through the boroughs.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I smile at the black-haired man and murmur "Hello Mandarc, good to see you" as he rushes past me. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Upon seeing Straud, I nod my head respectfully. "So glad you could make it Vlad, I hope the entertainment is up to your standards" wink. I then turn and look up at Askuwheteau and after a moment's pause: </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Kwey kwey Askuwheteau, ki mino pimadiz na" (Hello Askuwheteau, how are you?) </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Indeed. I have high expectations for you, Magister."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The three make their way into the house. Straud surveys the sitting room and approaches the two mortal women. "Good evening, ladies. My name is Vladislaus Straud. Your two personages are new to me."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The mortals introduce themselves. Anyone with heightened senses will notice that a fresh perfume of perspiration begins to waft from the girls; Straud's presence, while not enough to send them fleeing in terror, has inspired a layer of sweat to exude from their skin. The vampires in the room feel their willpower test underneath the pressure of being in such proximity to the prey. But they all hold steady, encouraged by the shows of humanity from their compatriots. The odor soon begins to dissipate.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So please, enlighten me as to how you met this proper scoundrel of a man." He says loud enough for Davian to hear him.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The girls launch into a short tale of adventure, talking more about themselves than the mage himself. Stephanie notes that they spoke about space exploration and hopeful colonization by none other than the famous billionaire. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ah, Ian Dusk. A show of what can go wrong when one grows up surrounded by every need granted. It is a pity that so many throw their loyalty behind him and his misguided companies. But if they can conjure such a following, perhaps there is still hope for the rest of us."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I, myself, run a little cabaret. We don't perform just any old dramas, no, our content is handpicked by the most well-read individuals with which I can fetch an audience. We sell a vision of a world of good Samaritans, environmentalists, and other do-gooders. But do we enjoy the same fame?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He leaves the question hanging and no one dares answer it. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vatore. It is good to see you."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"And you too, Count."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud turns to Chiasa and reaches out his hand, looking to greet her with a kiss on the back of her hand. "I am glad to see Davian is taking such good care of you."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"I think the ladies hit most of the important points" I saw as I casually head over to Straud. "Though don't let him downplay the BV, even Sebastian Erikksson has been known to stop by". </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica lights up at a familiar name. "Sebastian Eriksson? You have got to be kidding me. Did you see <i>Combustion</i>? It was fantastic."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb gently responds. "I saw it."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I didn't -- what's this one about?" Mandarc asks.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica gives a general description of the film -- a space thriller where Sebastian finds himself alone in space and must contend with a presumably killer alien who lurks in the shadows of an abandoned lab on the Moon.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I can't believe I missed this one, I try to keep up with Seb's filmography." Mandarc remarks. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud surprisingly responds to the commentary. "It was released a few years ago." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica seems to be a bit of an expert on Sebastian Eriksson and continues to talk about him. "He seems to be taking a bit of a break from acting over the past few years. He hasn't been in anything."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb provides some clarification. "He's engaged. Maybe he's taking some time for himself and his bride-to-be."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A bit ballsy if you ask me -- making all these movies. It could quickly take a turn for the worse." Cedric delivers a healthy dose of pessimism to the conversation.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Straud snaps up the conversation, sensing it devolving into hearsay and gossip. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I daresay that his fame may be something we can work to our advantage, should we need it."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We've talked at length about his chosen vocation and about the safety precautions he must take. I trust his judgment." And of course, the implication was "and you should too."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica seizes the silence to clear her mind. Unfortunately it is mostly drivel resulting from Sebastian's glamour.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I just can't believe he's really a...a..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vampire?" Mandarc fills in the gap.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"If you'd have told me before today --" Veronica stumbles over her words.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Are you telling me that today is your first introduction into the world of the occult?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud to Davian: <i>My, my. What lucky little girls you've brought into your web.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It's true... Stephanie and I are new to everything. I just hope it's not a dream that fades as soon as we step out that door."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"How fortunate you are to be privy to a very serious set of truths. I certainly hope -- " he pauses for a moment, and you feel a shift in the tone, "you will not be taking advantage of our favor. You are to tell no one about your meeting this evening. In fact, it will be most believable if the two of you were to have gathered at a local bar and drank too much to fathom speaking about it in polite conversation."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud is still rather relaxed, although both Cedric and Mandarc have become quiet, lending a serious air to the gathering.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I am not the type to make idle threats, nor would you sense my hand upon your fates should you disobey me. I suggest you regard what you have seen and will see tonight as entirely confidential. You two have stumbled upon a world of wonder through sheer dumb luck. Do not undervalue that." </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"You can trust us." Stephanie speaks for the both of them, a shaky voice betraying the difficulty in fully absorbing all she's been shown. "I mean, who would believe us? I don't think we could just walk into the police station --" She stops, the image feeling ridiculous. "They'd throw us in the crazy house."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Ever the diplomat, Straud responds with measured calm. "An outcome we would all like to avoid."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Speaking of paperwork, as an exchange for your vow of silence, I offer you both protection from my kind. So long as you remain within Queens, none of my kind will prey upon you or your family. You will be one of our esteemed friends. And we will protect you from becoming the victims of those that live outside our borders. I cannot speak for the other boroughs."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica seems desperate to speak of Sebastian Eriksson. Or anything less heavy than this conversation.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric's cellphone buzzes and he leaves out the front door, standing on the porch.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"T-thank you, sir." Veronica speaks, unsure of how exactly to address Straud, being unaccustomed to using titles. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I think I speak for both of us, Count," Stephanie chimes in, "When I say that neither of us will speak a word of this night to anyone else. Not even ourselves, even, because someone could overhear us. No, there's nothing to say, nothing to talk about, unless we are in your company."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc smirks (letting the silence speak for itself for a moment) and then swiftly fades over toward a curio cabinet. "You've got quite the collection of baubles here, Davian. I've been in the market for a good telescope --" but he stops when the sound of the door echoes through the room.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">I now shift to address the whole group.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Now that that's out of the way, let's take a vote: shall we spend some time on the beach or at my ski lodge?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"I didn't bring sunscreen, so I'm boned either way." Mandarc says bombastically, trying to keep up the spirits of the group.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What about the beach at night? We could all go star-gazing." Stephanie pipes up.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The party seems to gravitate toward this option, with Caleb voicing gentle agreement and Straud seeming to wait for everyone else to make up their mind.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin greets Davian with a handshake that seems relaxed, genial.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"Kevin, glad you could make it. Good timing as well, I was about to open door no.1."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Addressing the group: "Beach by night sounds great, and if it happens to get too bright I can whip something up." He walks over to a nondescript door just a few feet down. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Stephanie and Veronica, would you do the honors?" I instruct the two women to grab the handle and open the door together. A tropical breeze wafts through the room, full of floral perfumes mingled with the tang of sea water. Through the doorway lies a crescent shaped white-sand beach, gentle waves lapping at the shore. The moon hangs high in the sky, bathing the scene in a gentle, silver light. A number of teak and canvas beach chairs lie haphazardly on the sand, along with a number of small tables and a bar with tiki torches. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ladies and gentlemen, last in the water is a rotten egg".</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The group goes through the door single-file, each in turn marveling at the seamless transition from sitting room to beach. The beach is perfection, truly like a scene from one's imagination. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian -- you've really outdone yourself. This is marvelous." He walks onto the beach, stopping afterward to remove his shoes.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica sheepishly approaches the Magister. "Davian, is there any way... My bathing suit. Can you bring it here? I'm sorry if I'm asking too many questions..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric, Kevin, and Mandarc have also removed their shoes and are wading in the water, crystal-clear in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb, too, has entered the beach, but remains sort of off-set from the other vampires, choosing instead to wander off by himself.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">All at once a glimmer falls over Veronica and she instantly is re-outfitted in an impeccably tailored red and white bathing suit. It doesn't have flowers on it, but it does have delicate frills of lace around the legs and arms. The red panel over the front and back is a lovely fabric with a striped texture and there is a copper zipper coming up the front of the suit.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Veronica is visibly impressed with your transfiguration. It seems to bolster her resolve, seeing magic used for something she can wrap her head around.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The scene has been watched over by the rest of the crew despite being relatively dispersed over the beach; Stephanie acknowledges the feat and even seems a little jealous. She quickly goes to Davian to ask him the favor.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So you've been talking with Kali about getting released? What about Roxanne?" Mandarc tries to speak covertly but his voice is fairly easy to eavesdrop.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Roxanne is doing well. She's on the mend." Cedric talks a little more quietly as Straud approaches the group.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I don't think any good can be derived from keeping her locked up. If she doesn't want to ally with us, that's her prerogative. But she's just a burden on us this way." Kevin spoke carefully, diplomatically.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They continue shooting the shit about the prisoner.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb seems to be watching small fish swim about his toes, eager to get away from the commotion that constantly surrounded the Caitiff of Queens.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A giggle can be heard from Stephanie as the two girls engage in chatter. Their mood seems to have improved since escaping to the beach. </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">When he turns back around, he is caught off-guard by the pattern of ripples in the water. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Uh... Guys?" He backs away, slowly at first, and then turns around and runs as fast as he can toward the beach.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc is the first to notice the disturbance. "Caleb?" he calls out as Caleb splashes messily toward the shore.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">But Ben reaches his hand forward and helps Caleb to his feet.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb laughs nervously, but he is not overly perturbed. More amused. "T-that was you? You had me." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Off to the side, Straud smiles slightly at the show of mischief.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc starts clapping. "Ben! That was great. Caleb, you okay? Sorry that had to be at your expense but that was..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric interrupts. "Very impressive."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud delivers a quiet aside. "Indeed."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The girls have barely noticed the excitement; they're wrapped up in building a sandcastle.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb chuckles half to himself. "Well after all that excitement, I could use another drink." He walks over to Davian. "This portal is...two-way, right? I can pop over and head back?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin speaks quietly. "I think I missed introductions. Ben --"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But Straud interrupts. "Ben is a werecat. An old friend of mine. His ability to change his shape is unparalleled."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin seems to be coming into understanding. "Is he one of the Glasswalkers?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"No, he has journeyed over a far distance. I am not sure we could get through to the Glasswalkers. Old grudges die slowly. At any rate, it is good Ben is on our side. He brings much wisdom to our circle. I am comforted by his presence. I have not seen him in many, many years."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin continues. "A werecat, very unusual. Father had some dealings with the werewolves upstate some years ago but a cat -- He must have traveled from far away."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I suspect his home has been subject to the same decay much of the Wild has been suffering." Straud keeps his eyes on the scene, as do his fellow vampires.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"One thing you should know about Fera, we have great hearing."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I meet Kevin's gaze directly but without overt hostility. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You are correct; the years have not been kind to my people, even before the Europeans came to the Pure Land."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"We have traipsed over their territory before, although not intentionally." Straud admits. "I extended an invitation to the Blue Velvet but no one ever came."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Perhaps it is better this way."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We can't help that they hate us for being what we are." Mandarc says rather matter-of-factly. "I didn't choose to be what I am. What makes me any less natural than one of the Fera? I still obey the laws of physics."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"That's not what they mean and you know it." Cedric quips with irritation. "Parasitism is what they object to."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Parasites exist in nature."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It doesn't mean anyone is going to tolerate it. People don't like snakes or spiders either. They aren't like them. We're not like them. We are an affront to nature."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"See, that's always stuck in my craw. Natural this, natural that...It's natural for humanity to progress. It's natural for Man to explore his environment, make his life easier, have babies, what-have-you. Just because he chops down a few trees in the process doesn't make him unnatural. Everyone utilizes the things around him, that's just basic tool use."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We're not essential to the ecosystem in any way, shape, or form. If every vampire burst into flames tomorrow there would be little change to life on Earth as we know it. We're a hanger-on, a leech, even." Cedric speaks plainly, with a surprising amount of distance.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">I shrug uncomfortably at this change in the conversation and turn to address Mandarc. "You will excuse me, but there is a flaw in your reasoning. You are not alive, nor are you dead. You are a static element in the ever-changing  sea of life, a manifestation of the Wyrm's sickness that will never return the gifts it has taken to the earth. It is not your status as a predator that provokes the ire of my kind, but your very essence." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"However, in the long years I have spent in Gaia's embrace I have seen many strange and 'unnatural' things, and have gained some measure of wisdom, including the limits of my own understanding. Perhaps you were born for a greater purpose, one that has yet to be fully revealed."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I shrug again and meet Cedric's gaze "I often wonder how I would behave if I had my identity suddenly stripped away, and I know what it is to be considered a monster".</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"I don't even remember receiving the dark gift. I have tendrils of memory, but I have no way to know what's real and what's imagined. I didn't choose this path, or at least I don't remember choosing, so how am I supposed to do penance? What I did choose to do was run away from Trelaine."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Trelaine is an old associate of Straud's with whom we're on shaky terms." Cedric clarifies for Ben.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We were friends. Once." Straud comments.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You wanna talk about a monster. He uses his powers of persuasion to seduce mortals into near-slavery. He makes promises he never intends to keep. He splices --" Mandarc seems to get jittery at the discussion.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"Speeding and slowing the passage of time ain't got nothin' on this, right Ced?" Mandarc files through the portal with the rest.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm off the clock." Cedric states.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"This is very impressive, Davian. You've outdone yourself." Straud compliments as he walks through the portal. "You'd better be careful or I'll start throwing my parties at your home."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"All the more reason we need to get the school up and running again." Cedric says to Kevin.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Get the school up and running again? Is that the kind of gossip you've been parroting while I've been out of the room?" Kevin seems a little flustered. "I don't know if reopening the school is the best option for us right now. We don't have the staff, we don't have the materials -- much of our collection was damaged in the fire."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm just... Not sure about reopening the school. It was my parents' dream, I know... But I fear it will just attract the wrong kind of publicity nowadays."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Is it the school you want? New talent? Surely bleaching pinafores and playclothes is not exactly what you have in mind but I'm not sure we have the time necessary to relaunch the school in a meaningful way. There are other ways to find new talent..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We need mages." Cedric protests. "Their magic is limitless. Look at this! Vampires cannot accomplish such feats. There was a reason you took the cure."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"Jupiter is indeed a boon to the community around him. Without his protections, we'd all be lost." Straud agrees with Davian.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But Cedric and Kevin are straying dangerously close to an argument, their voices becoming slightly heated. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What's come over you, anyway? I thought you would be happy to see the school remain closed." Kevin accuses Cedric.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I have been working over what I've seen, what Davian can accomplish, and it's reminded me that our mission, our world, will perish without us expanding our vision. New talent, young talent, that's what I want to see. Get at the kids before someone else puts the wrong sorts of ideas in their heads."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin turns to Davian to respond to his inquiry, continuing his train of thought. "I'm sure Mother would be happy to take up the mantle of Headmistress again, I'm just not sure she's ready. She was depressed for years after her students left, ready to toss her fate to the wind. One might say the return of her students would help, but I'm not so certain. She's hardly the voice of the young generation."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Then we'll find someone else to lead." Cedric suggests. "It was your father's idea to start the school in the first place, was it not?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Father probably saw the world much like you do, in need of great feats. But it still stands that he wasn't able to lead classes himself, or lecture about the history of witchcraft in the Americas during the midday sun when the children were awake. And though my father had all the best intentions, he laid a lot on my mother's lap. And, I would argue, she was unable to handle all the pressure. We're lucky we had such good kids pass through those doors. Tzu, Elmer, even Larry's not a bad guy. But is Mother really going to be able to handle a young person who doesn't have the best interests of the world at heart?"</p>

Tzu would be a good choice, but I think she and Sebastian have settled into LA?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Taking a step back from logistical issues, I must agree with Cedric. You can be sure that the Nephandi are recruiting every Spark they can find, and this...Trelane, is no doubt embracing every likely prospect.

<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric chuckles half to himself, then turns to Straud. "She does browse the archives, right? She's gotten some use out of her imprisonment?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud speaks carefully and without humor. "I am not in the habit of disclosing other's habits on the Web, lest you'd like to also be found without the promise of privacy."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"But it had your father's name on it." Caleb protests.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I do not think Father always loved his lot. I think sometimes he wished for the world to be a different place."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We all have regrets." Straud interjects and everyone looks at him, hoping for him to deliver some sound sliver of advice. But he ends the commentary there.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What do you think?" Kevin points the question right at Straud in an almost aggressive manner. "Should we reopen the school? You knew Father better than anyone else here."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It does not concern your father. It does not concern your mother. It concerns only the children you hope to bring to fruition. Your parents have raised many good younglings and for that they should be proud."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud turns to Davian. "If we can find people we trust, then I give my blessing. But it all hinges on that. Just one grain of rice can tip the scale."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"But let us all not forget our commitments at home. Cedric, the Zhou family has only just recently come under your umbrella. Kevin, your mind is not fully your own."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Something I struggle with every day." Kevin admits quietly. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I won't be neglecting the Zhou family." Cedric responds with measured calm. "They're more experienced than they let on."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Something I agree with but they still require our protection. They always will, as their children will never age." Straud gently reminds him.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I won't let my responsibilities hold me back. But I think the school is our best bet at ensuring the continued safety of our little... clan."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Davian, Adam, and Kevin take their places, and hold hands, creating the triangle. Dust begins to sheet away from the diagram, pushed aside by the eldritch forces being summoned, and arcs of energy jump between the participants in dazzling patterns. A body forms in the center circle, slowly gaining definition.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">After what seems like hours, the observers notice a change in the flow of energy accompanied by a sensation of tearing, as if reality itself strains with the energies being unleashed. With a final catastrophic nova of incandescent motes, four people stand at the center of a small crater.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I stand back and look around at the crowd of observers. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"And that ladies and gentlemen, is no humbug".</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The rest of the crowd looks on with amazement toward the display. It takes a considerable amount of time, but time seems nothing here. The sparks of light compete with the planet's swirling gases for the onlookers' attentions. The light fades and there is a tall man unsteady on his feet in the center circle.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin rushes forward and catches the man before he stumbles.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Dad? Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But nothing can be heard from the man at first -- he walks uneasily, leaning on his son for support. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Where are we?" are Vincent's first words.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin laughs gently at the question. "We're... uh... Just outside of Jupiter. Just an ordinary day..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Vincent mumbles a humorous obscenity and then makes to sit on the ground. "What have you all done?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We've freed you, Dad. You're back with us, on Earth. Or, at least, soon."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Vincent is wearing the same clothes he wore on the day he suffered Death -- a thinning grey sweater and dockers the color of tree bark. His shoes are a gently tapered dress shoe with a rounded toe, also brown.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The three of you did... <i>that...</i> for me?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yeah, Dad. We did."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"...Thank you." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He pauses for a moment, then looks around, arms supported by his knees. He looks tired.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Straud. Cedric. And is that Caleb Vatore? It's good to see the three of you again. It's been a little while."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc rushes forward and pushes his hand toward the seated man. "Vincent Marscapone. I'm Mandarc Soo."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"'Soo'? As in my wife's last name?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As if he's stuck his foot in his mouth, Mandarc pauses. "Yes... It is your wife's maiden name. I never had a last name and I took it to honor the effort she put into making me feel welcome here among your family."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Does your mother know?" Vincent asks Kevin.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Not yet. But Davian was hoping to help her as well..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Vincent climbs to his feet and approaches Davian, standing next to Adam. "Davian. We haven't met. I'm Vincent Marscapone. I want to thank you for showing mercy toward me and my family. You are an unusual mage."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I offer my hand "Pleasure. You are most welcome, but, it is not mercy to help a friend. As to the latter, that may be, but I stand in good company in that respect." (I make a small gesture that encompasses the group).</p>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm fortunate to count you among my friends."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">With a flourish, Straud employs the simplest of instruments, applause. Starting slow, soon everyone joins in as the group recollects now that the ritual is complete. Walking toward each other, there is a genuine feeling of warmth and camaraderie in the air. Straud and Vincent start a gesture that blends handshake into hug. "Welcome back, friend."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Next, Vincent turns to Cedric and hugs him. Cedric breaks into a bright smile. "Nice to see you again, Master." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There is a pause, and Vincent looks behind him, where Kevin is talking with Adam. The chatter is parted with a moment of silence as Vincent gets a look at his son, for the first time in twenty years. Vincent walks over toward him and hugs him. "Thank you, son."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So where were we before we were on a rock outside Jupiter?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Laughter ripples through the group as Davian guides Vincent and the rest to the gateway; passing through, they find themselves in the Foyer at 78 Perry. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The party continues for several more hours, no one quite ready to break the giddiness that comes with accomplishing the impossible. All good things must come to an end, however, and the first touch of light on the horizon finds Davian and Adam alone by the fireplace, sharing a Scooby Snack and watching 'The Matrix".</p>
