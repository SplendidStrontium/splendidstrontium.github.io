*****
*****
<br><i>I often struggle to comprehend the young Marscapone in face of the terrible tragedies he's had to endure. A life of isolation imposed rather than chosen. An imprisonment forced rather than asked.</i>
<br><br>

*****
<br><i>It wasn't I who mastered the art of the three-gaze painting. Even if a Mundane views it, it seems to oscillate between three appearances. Usually the young maid, the Matron, & the Old Maid.</i>

<i>But a Mortal is so fixated on the fact that it must only show one face that this is what they see -- one face. But in the thickness of midnight shadows, it takes on an iridescent sheen that the viewer is finally, again, uncertain of what he's seen.</i>

<i>It is that moment of second doubt that contains the true power of the three-gaze painting. For then, understanding becomes a familiar houseguest, welcome again in your halls of knowledge.</i>

<i>And that is what Vincent grants to them in his vast castle. A glimpse of the end days, ultimate comprehension, truly, Heaven, before he turns them off like an extinguished Star, sets them to sleep, grants them eternal rest. Is it cruel to end their suffering and ban<u>ish</u> them from the Haunt?</i>
