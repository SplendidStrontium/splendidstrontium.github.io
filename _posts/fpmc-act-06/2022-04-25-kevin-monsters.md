<br><i>Cedric doesn't live far from the Magicademy so I find myself inclined to walk. The sunshine bears down on my hair, warming the top of my skull. It's a welcome sensation after the winter's chill.</i>

<i>I suppose I made a unusual presentation in my blue tailcoat. But my clothing formed a barrier between myself and exposure to the desolate Mortal cityscape. Still stranger are the rich auburn hairs that the wind occasionally blows into my field of vision. I wasn't born that way. I was born with brown hair like my mother and father.</i>

<i>It wasn't until after Straud cured my vampirism that I had started to change. The onset was rapid. Like a second puberty, all that I'd gotten used to packed up and left town. My hairline, once receded, tracked back over my temples. My cheeks took on a rosy hue after consumption of wine. I possessed energy like I'd never known and became determined to shake off the habits of my sedentary lifestyle. But my frame could not yet take the exertion.</i>

<i>I kept going; I keep going. But I could not help looking backward.</i>

<i>My very young years I was neither vampire nor mage. Like many things, I had taken the sunbeams trickling in through my blinds for granted. Just as the Doctor Trelaine had predicted, my father's curse began to set in around my fourteenth year of age. I had started to become lethargic, food disgusted me as I continued to lose weight, but perhaps most damning was the new set of teeth that began to emerge.</i>

<i>Trelaine had taken my juvenile set shortly after kidnapping me as a child. He had tried to win my sympathy by beseeching my favor, promising me a normal-looking maw. But he'd been unable to deliver.</i>

<i>But it was not long until my adult teeth grew in, along with other hallmarks of the curse.</i>

<i>There was no debating the point any longer: I was a Vampire.</i>

<i>And so I remained, accepting my fate, until Straud offered me a way out.</i>

<i>I took him up on his offer, thinking Death a fate well-suited to me. My fangs crumbled like pressed sawdust and my heart pounded in my chest for the first time in decades.</i>

<i>And then it happened. It came to me. </i>

<i>The Talent.</i>

<i>Normally the Talent comes to children, and well it does. It was overwhelming to me in those early days. I was concerned with sleeping at night, remembering to breathe, and tolerating the near-constant obsession with food that facilitated a Mortal's life. I'm not sure I would have made it without the guidance of my friends and family.</i>

<i>But something nagged at me, warning me to not become complacent. For even if today I could stand in a sunbeam and know of my growing power over the elements, I knew tomorrow it could topple like a house of cards.</i>

<br><i>I had taken up the habit a couple of years prior to provide a distraction against the anxieties that clouded my mind post-vampirism. Under the curse's power, I had been dominated by an obsession with satisfying my thirst. The constant barrage had been soothing to my psyche in its own insidious way. The transition had been more difficult than the onset ever was.</i>

<i>I lacked my father's soothing hand.</i>

<i>Our clan had a social character such that I was never truly alone. But cast again into the Mortal flame, I was a singleton. Shadow engulfed my future and I became frightened of it in a way never known to me when I flitted from prey to prey.</i>

<br><i>And so I'd taken up the habit. The smell was comforting to me as I tried to grok my mother's existence in any possible way. She, too, had become increasingly dependent on the compulsion as her days no longer contained the endless concerns of the Orphans.</i>

<i>I supposed, she missed them too. And she missed my father.</i>

#### AVAEL

> WELCOME HOME, KEVIN.

<BR><I>The bot opened the door, bid me welcome, and quickly motioned an intention to rejoin whatever task I'd parted her from.</i>

<I>It was true; I'd lived here for a time. But that time seemed long ago.</i>

<i>The basement contained a single holding cell my father had used during his war with the Doctor Trelaine. The bars were a thick silver, now long-tarnished by age and time.</i>

<i>It was within these walls we'd placed the near-feral Vampress Kali Shyãmã.</i>

<i>She'd recognized me, transition and all, as she was subdued and restrained.</i>

> #### KALI

> > SON OF ONE OF THE OLD GREAT ONES.

<BR><I>Today she sat neatly upon the cot staring out into the musty air. She must have heard my footfalls as she looks at me expectantly. She is a sight to behold with the whites of her eyes sharply contrasting her near-raven skin. Her hair is wild and untamed, forming a crown above an intense gaze.</i>

<i>I step into the chamber but bars still divide us.</i>

> MARSCAPONE.
