<P style="text-decoration: underline;">| + Junior's State of the Union </p>

* When I loaded into the Landgraab household, the leading lord and lady had glitched out to have no relationship at all; they weren't broken up or exes or anything like that -- the bar had just set itself to zero.
* I quickly got them engaged and am setting it straight for the story by saying they broke up, did not fully separate, and reconciled. They are pre-wedding ceremony and I will save the marriage for later I guess.
* Gemma Charm lives here as the last extant member of the Charm family. I did not kill Darrell on purpose but he is gone without a way to get him back.
* Gemma and Malcolm supposedly went to high school together.
* Pretty sure Gemma aged up during the <u>Happy Birthday Crisis</u> because she has the trait 'Slob' and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have chosen that for her.
* G. Landgraab has established himself as a friend to Viraj, not that it's the be-all, end-all of this reality.
* There is a certain reality in which Cedric can spy on the Landgraabs but I'm unsure how this moves forward into the current reality.
