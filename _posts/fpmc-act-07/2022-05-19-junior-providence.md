### // CHARM MANSION //

<br><i>Tonight, like many nights, Trente Gagarin has invited Caleb Vatore to spend the night at her alcove of the Charm Mansion. He obliges happily.</i>

<i>Unlike the female, Caleb was immune to the damaging effects of the sun's rays. His skin shone as dashed mirrorlight when he was out-of-doors.</i>

<i>Trente had no such protection. She blamed it on a life lived entirely inside walls and under ceilings.</i>

#### TRENTE

> CALEB, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

#### CALEB

> GO AHEAD, SHOOT.

#### TRENTE

> I KNOW YOU HAVE AN AVERSION TO DRINKING THE BLOOD OF HUMANS BUT HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT OF OTHER VAMPIRES?

<BR><I>Caleb's face goes slack. It's just the reaction she'd expected.</i>

#### CALEB

> I...UH...GUESS I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE.
> 
> I DON'T KNOW, I JUST NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

#### TRENTE

> THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EVIL.

<BR><I>She meant it as a compliment.</i>

#### CALEB

> YOU CAN REALLY JUST DO THAT?
> 
> DRAIN ANOTHER OF OUR KIND?
> 
> THAT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.

#### TRENTE

> IF YOU CAN SUBDUE THEM, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

<BR><I>She pauses a moment, caught on her own zeal.</i>

#### TRENTE

> WOULD YOUR SAME AVERSIONS APPLY?

#### CALEB

> I...I DON'T KNOW.

#### TRENTE

> IF IT WERE SOMEONE YOU HAD TO FIGHT AND YOU'D DEFEATED HIM IN FAIR COMBAT, I'D SAY IT'S FAIR.
> 
> NEVER LEAVE WITNESSES.

#### CALEB

> I THINK MY FATHER WOULD HAVE FILED IT UNDER HIS HOPES FOR VEGETARIANISM IN THE GARDEN.

#### TRENTE

> BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT PITY FOR THE PREY, IT'S ABOUT PROPERLY DISPOSING OF THE BODY OF YOUR DEFEATED FOE.
> 
> THEY'LL REGENERATE AND HARBOR A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU UNTIL THE TIME COMES THAT THEY CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN.
> 
> ONLY THEY'VE PREPARED MORE THIS TIME.

#### CALEB

> IT SEEMS BARBARIC.

#### TRENTE

> IT IS BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
> 
> KNOW THAT A VAMPIRE WHO WANTS YOU DEAD IS NOT THE SAME AS INNOCENT PREY.

#### CALEB

> I GUESS.

#### TRENTE

> ALSO KNOW THAT IF YOU TRULY THROW YOUR LOT IN WITH ME, THERE MAY BE SOME WHO WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

#### CALEB

> I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HATE YOU AS THEY DO.

#### TRENTE

> I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.
> 
> BUT I MUST REALIZE THAT I REPRESENT THE OLD REGIME.
> 
> SOME PREFER LAWLESSNESS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEIR POWER STRUCTURES THRIVE.
> 
> I WILL ELIMINATE SUCH ANARCHY.
> 
> NO MORE HIDING BEHIND THE MORTALS' SKIRTS.
> 
> I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE, CALEB.
> 
> YOU HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO OUR CAUSE SINCE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A FAIRYTALE.

#### CALEB

> I WAS JUST GLAD TO DISCOVER YOU WERE REAL.

#### TRENTE

> I PLAN TO REWARD YOUR FAITH.

#### CALEB

> I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU.

#### TRENTE

> IF WE EVER FIND OURSELVES WARRING AGAINST THE INSURGENTS, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE POWER OF THE DEFEATED.

#### CALEB

> WOULDN'T YOU BE SERVED BETTER...?

#### TRENTE

> NOT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD.
> 
> IT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.

<BR><I>He takes a moment to collect his thoughts and speaks quietly and carefully.</i>

#### CALEB

> THAT'S...QUITE A GIFT.

#### TRENTE

> NOT AS MUCH AS YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.

<BR>
