<br><i>I knew I had to tell the Master the truth before I let my chattering teeth give me away. I knew that it was my own weakness that would keep me from keeping the secret from him.</i>

#### MANDARC

> MASTER, IT IS LOOKING SO FAR THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY, BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
> 
> THE TRUTH IS THAT I APPLIED WHEN I LIVED HERE WITH FRIDAY PERKINS.
> 
> SHE ENCOURAGED ME, SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, BUT I THINK IT WAS JUST HER WAY OF SAYING SHE WANTED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

#### STRAUD

> YOU DID THIS WHILE YOU WERE UNDER MY EMPLOY?
> 
> WAS MY GUIDANCE NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE SEEKING THE WISDOM OF THE MORTALS?

#### MANDARC

> IT IS NOT WISDOM, BUT CONNECTIONS.

#### STRAUD

> YOU WERE NOT LOOKING FOR CONNECTIONS THREE YEARS AGO.
> 
> YOU DID NOT HAVE THIS IDEA THREE YEARS AGO.

#### MANDARC

> I WAS UNAWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE MORTALS PLACED ON THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURES.

#### STRAUD

> THEY CALL IT NETWORKING.

#### MANDARC

> YES, PRECISELY.

#### STRAUD

> YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE, ARE YOU NOT?
> 
> THEIR WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CERTAIN ALLURE TO YOU.

#### MANDARC

> IF THE WORLD TRULY IS CHANGING, I WANT OUR INTERESTS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT.

#### STRAUD

> YOU BELIEVE IN THE FRUIT.

#### MANDARC

> IT'S BEEN KEEPING ME GOING THROUGH MY TIME WITH EMMITT.

#### STRAUD

> SURELY YOU HAVE NOT ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF --

#### MANDARC

> NO, MASTER, I WOULD NEVER!!
> 
> NOT THE LITTLE ONE WHO YOU SAVED FROM THE PITS OF DESPAIR.
> 
> I WOULD NEVER SINK TO SUCH A LEVEL AS TO TAKE FROM SOMEONE YOU'VE TASKED ME TO PROTECT.

#### STRAUD

> HIS FATHER IS AN ELF.

#### MANDARC

> AN ELF, SIR?

#### STRAUD

> DO YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR ANOTHER TITLE FOR THEM?

#### MANDARC

> ELF SEEMS GOOD ENOUGH TO ME, JUST...

#### STRAUD

> JUST...WHAT?

#### MANDARC

> HUMANS USUALLY THINK OF ELVES AS BEING LOCAL-TYPE CREATURES.
> 
> NOT SPACE-FARING.
> 
> CREATURES FROM THEIR OWN PLANE.
> 
> THEY'RE USUALLY A MORE ANCIENT VERSION OF THEMSELVES. A LOVE-LETTER TO THEIR PAST GLORIES.
> 
> THERE'S SOMETHING ALWAYS ELUSIVE ABOUT ELVES -- THEIR TRIUMPHS OFTEN THOUGHT UNATTAINABLE BY MODERN MAN.

#### STRAUD

> AND HERE I THOUGHT IT JUST CAME DOWN TO THE POINTED EARS.

#### MANDARC

> THAT'S CERTAINLY PART OF IT.

#### STRAUD

> ALL I NEED IS SOMETHING WITH WHICH THE MORTALS ARE VAGUELY AWARE.

#### MANDARC

> I'LL SAY SOMETHING ELSE TOO.
> 
> THE HUMANS AREN'T USED TO THINKING OF THE ELVES AS EVIL.

#### STRAUD

> EVIL?
> 
> WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT EVIL?

#### MANDARC

> UH...

#### STRAUD

> THE ELVES ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME.
> 
> I CANNOT, AND DO NOT, BEGRUDGE THEM THAT.
> 
> I SIMPLY WISH THEY'D INVESTED MORE TIME IN TRYING TO SALVAGE WHAT THEY ALREADY HAD.

#### MANDARC

> SO THEY'RE COLONIZERS.

#### STRAUD

> THEY ARE WOULD-BE COLONIZERS, YES.

#### MANDARC

> I THINK, WITH THE PROPER LEADERSHIP, WE COULD EASILY SHOW OURSELVES AS ADVOCATES FOR MANKIND.

#### STRAUD

> WE ARE HUNTERS, PREDATORS, EVEN AT TIMES OPPRESSORS. 
> 
> I DOUBT THE HUMANS WILL SEE US AS ANYTHING BUT MONSTERS.
> 
> AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WRONG. 

#### MANDARC

> BUT...THE FRUIT...

#### STRAUD

> CANNOT REPLACE OUR NEED FOR LIFEFORCE. 
> 
> IT MAY SLAKE THE COMPULSION TEMPORARILY BUT EXTENDED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE HUNT WILL LEAVE US EXHAUSTED AND USELESS.

#### MANDARC

> THEN WE'LL JUST USE IT AS ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR ARSENAL.

#### STRAUD

> AND YET, WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?
> 
> TO TELL THE WORLD OF OUR NEFARIOUS PAST AND EXPECT ACCEPTANCE AND UNENDING FORGIVENESS?

#### MANDARC

> WE COULD SHOW OURSELVES INTERESTED IN MAKING AMENDS.

#### STRAUD

> THEY WILL TAKE THE FRUIT FROM YOU.

#### MANDARC

> GOOD THING WE HAVE YOUR RESERVES.

#### STRAUD

> YOU SHOULD NOT REST YOUR HEAD ON SUCH AN UNEVEN FOUNDATION.

#### MANDARC

> OH, MASTER, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE HERE.

#### STRAUD

> NOT IF YOU'RE HELD UP IN ONE OF THE MORTAL'S PRISONS.
> 
> NO, THERE ARE PLACES I MAY NOT GO.
> 
> I WILL TRY TO AID YOU IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN TROUBLE BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS EVEN I CANNOT DO.

<BR><I>Mandarc opens his mouth to speak but he is quickly pre-empted.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THAT IS, OF COURSE, ASSUMING THEY DON'T CAPTURE YOU AND STAKE YOU FIRST.
> 
> OF COURSE, THEY'D HAVE TO BELIEVE IN SOME OF THE OLD MYTHS, AND THAT LEAP OF FAITH IS DIFFICULT FOR OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

#### MANDARC

> NONE OF THEM CAN CAPTURE ME IN A FIGHT.

#### STRAUD

> A FAIR FIGHT.
> 
> NONE OF THEM CAN CAPTURE YOU IN A FAIR FIGHT.
> 
> BUT THERE ARE SEVEN BILLION OF THEM AND ONE OF YOU.

#### MANDARC

> POPULATION GROWTH FOR HUMANS ON EARTH IS APPROXIMATELY 1.04% PER YEAR.
> 
> I THINK WITH OUR NEW ACQUISITIONS, WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN THAT.

#### STRAUD

> TOO GOOD. 
> 
> WE DEPEND ON THEM, TOO MANY OF US MEANS MORE COMPETITION.

#### MANDARC

> AND MORE THINBLOOD.

#### STRAUD

> YOU KNOW I HATE THAT TERM.

#### MANDARC

> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US CALL THEM?

#### STRAUD

> NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS A NAME.

#### MANDARC

> BUT THEY ARE A PEOPLE.

#### STRAUD

> THEY ARE OUR KIND AND CAN BE REFERRED TO BY THEIR GIVEN NAMES.
> 
> TO DO OTHERWISE IS TO REDUCE THEM. AND TO REDUCE OTHERS IS TO REDUCE ONESELF.

#### MANDARC

> I'D THINK THEY'RE JUST HAPPY TO BE INCLUDED.

#### STRAUD

> INCLUDED? 
> 
> THEY ARE HARDLY INCLUDED.

#### MANDARC

> YOU'VE GOT FRANKIE DOWN AT THE BAR...

#### STRAUD

> AND WHERE WOULD HE BE WITHOUT OUR SPONSORSHIP?

#### MANDARC

> YOUR SPONSORSHIP.

#### STRAUD

> AS WITH EVERYTHING, IT'S A GROUP EFFORT.
> 
> WE ARE INDELIBLY CONNECTED TO ALL OF OUR KIND AND IT BEHOOVES ONE TO PAY THE NECESSARY RESPECT.
> 
> THEY'RE THIS WORLD'S HALFLINGS.

<BR><I>I stop. I was unaware the Master was familiar with such terminology.</i>

#### MANDARC

> SIR, YOU AREN'T SUGGESTING...?

#### STRAUD

> THAT NEITHER TRUE HALFLINGS NOR DWARVES EXIST ON THIS PLANE.

#### MANDARC

> OH.
> 
> WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT.

#### STRAUD

> WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

#### MANDARC

> I...I DON'T REMEMBER.

#### STRAUD

> YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

#### MANDARC

> I DON'T REMEMBER!

#### STRAUD

> YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT FRIDAY PERKINS.

#### MANDARC

> I WAS?
> 
> I WAS -- WELL -- IT WAS WHEN I WAS LIVING WITH HER THAT I FILED MY INTEREST LETTER AT THE UNIVERSITY.
> 
> ...YOU KNOW, THAT BRINGS UP ANOTHER TOPIC: ONE OF THE FEW DREAMS I HAD INVOLVED FRIDAY.
> 
> I DREAMT THAT SHE -- OR SOMEONE WHO LOOKED SIMILAR TO HER -- WAS EITHER KEVIN OR VINCENT'S GIRLFRIEND FIRST. 
> 
> SHE DIED IN A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY AND THEN CAME BACK AS A SHADOW VERSION OF HERSELF BEFORE QUICKLY MORPHING INTO THE FRIDAY I KNOW.
> 
> IS IT TRUE KEVIN WAS --

#### STRAUD

> YOU DON'T DREAM, YOU ITERATE OVER THE PATH.

#### MANDARC

> WHAT I SAW ISN'T DREAMING?

#### STRAUD

> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

#### MANDARC

> BUT IS IT TRUE?

#### STRAUD

> NOT IN THIS REALITY.
> 
> BUT IT IS TRUE IN SOME REALM OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT.

#### MANDARC

> ISN'T THAT CIRCULAR LOGIC, SIR?

#### STRAUD

> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUGGEST AN IMPROVEMENT?

#### MANDARC

> IT COULD JUST BE A VISION OF NOTHING. 
> 
> OF RANDOMNESS.
> 
> OF MY OWN INSECURITIES MADE MANIFEST IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS.
> 
> MAYBE I'M NOT DREAMING, BUT MAYBE I'M NOT ITERATING OVER THE PATH, EITHER.

#### STRAUD

> MAY YOUR CYNICISM SET YOU FREE.

#### MANDARC

> IS THAT SARCASM I DETECT?

#### STRAUD

> YOU'RE REMINDING ME A GREAT DEAL OF WEASLIE THESE DAYS.

#### MANDARC

> TOO SIMPERING?

#### STRAUD

> OH, FORGET IT.

#### MANDARC

> I'M SORRY, MASTER.
