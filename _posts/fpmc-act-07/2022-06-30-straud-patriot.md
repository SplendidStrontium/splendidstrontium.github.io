<br>FROM: VLADISLAUS STRAUD (personal)

TO: GERTRUDE FULTON (personal)

Gertrude,

I'm writing on behalf of your recent inquiry at the Marscapone School of Magic. I am not a Marscapone but I think I will be able to help with your problem.

Greg is a friend of mine from times long past. I think if I pay him a visit, I can try to get through to him. However, there are two major obstacles I can see here: his rage and his loneliness. I think everyone can understand the core of that feeling. It is nothing anyone can "fix", old friends or not.

STRAUD

<br><i>A journey, that's what they wanted of me. </i>

<i>Sometimes people just get lucky. No one in the pack could have known about this long-lost association.</i>

<i>It was true that the letter had mentioned no name but I knew exactly who their neighbor was. We had been friends long ago, long before the first werewolf, long before the Moonpetal started its first season.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">The answer lies with Lilith Vatore.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Small world indeed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But there is more you should know. Lilith Vatore is not a vampire as was Kevin Marscapone. She was turned by me. The whole thing was fraught with half-truths and misunderstanding. And a lot of sorrow.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Yeah, well, it's silly.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">What, would she rather have dog breath?</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">So Lilith was a bit afraid of her future. One side of the family thought she'd make a good werewolf. But you knew better. They're still holding a grudge?</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
