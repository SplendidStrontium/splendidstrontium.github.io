<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The season has shifted from unseasonably warm to unseasonably cold. Outside 78 Perry, passersby bundle themselves into thick coats, bracing against the chilly air. The time is 8:20 PM and at this point, it's already been dark for several hours. From his rooftop paradise, with heightened vision, one might be able to see Polaris, perhaps the belt of Orion. The stars stay fixed in an sea of inky mystery, lending an aura of quiet, but peace? Peace is something yet to come. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Your phone buzzes, a certain sort of utterance you've keyed to indicate chatter from Straud's coterie. Like all warnings, it sounds no different than any other bing, but the silence that hangs in the air after its cessation feels ominous. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The creatures of the night generally say little to Davian Hughes, preferring instead to keep their little dramas to themselves. The channel might have held an invitation to the Blue Velvet, or juicy gossip. If not that, a request for a favor. But you feel a pit of concern linger in your heart after looking into the sky's abyss, knowing that in the deep beyond, an evil lurks, waiting for just the right moment to strike.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Perhaps you wonder, as you reach for the phone, if tonight is the night you'll get the news you've been fearing.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The phone recognizes your identity and populates. A small photograph of Cedric is the first to appear, along with text that fills in word by word as it is typed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Something's up. Vlad has fallen silent. I fear torpor. Did he say anything to you?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'll be there in a jiffy".</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I fold the space between his house and my house, stepping through the juncture and appearing on the porch in Jamaica Estates.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I tap on the back door with my cane</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A familiar face answers the door in an instant: it's Mandarc, looking, if it's possible, even more pallid than usual. His eyes shift about anxiously, scanning the environment behind you.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You enter the home and it's comfortably warm. A loud pop is heard from the fireplace.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thanks for getting here so quickly." He shuts the door behind you before continuing to speak.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I was just going to pick him up to drive him to Astoria when... When the house was silent."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As you step into the house, you observe two figures standing at the fireplace, staring into it, and seeming at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">One is Cedric, the other is Miriam, a dark-skinned vampire with a chin-length head of raven curls. You know she is one of the few vampires capable of healing magicks and seems to have long ago earned Straud's trust.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He's here, I can sense him, as I'm sure you can, but he's not responding to anything I send to him." She says, with a worried expression weighing down her delicate face.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He's gone into periods of inactivity before," she continues, "but it seems unusual that he'd not have said a word of warning to any of you." Miriam may have been an old friend of Straud's, but she was still a recent acquisition of the coterie and spoke with a certain air of cautiousness that spoke more of politeness than distrust. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Miriam. I don't know that we've met. But you must be Magister Davian. Your reputation precedes you. I only wish we'd met under better circumstances."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Indeed. As does yours, Madam Duatba. So, Vlad is comatose, even when attempting direct contact?"(I look over at Cedric)</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At Cedric's nod, I turn to the assembled party. 
"I am going to replay the events in the house from the last 24 hours as an interactive holographic projection. Let's see if He left us any clues."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric shifts his weight across his feet, moving forward toward you somewhat. "It's like talking to a picture of him. I know he's there, I know he's not in pain, but he won't respond." The unspoken fact is that only those of considerable power are able to refuse the telepathic connection. It's a refusal that is rarely faced in their circle.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian focuses, leaving the party silent to grant him mental space. His eyes open and suddenly a figure of light comes into focus. It's Straud, standing near the fireplace, moving logs with a cast iron poker. He moves only in tiny motions as the holographs speed up, indicating the passage of time. The day seems entirely ordinary; he spends some time keying in text to his pocket device, other moments are lost in pacing. He seems to be waiting on someone, or something. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He leaves the room for a time and lets in the dog via the back door. They greet warmly and leave the house to go out on the front walkway. There they play fetch, but something about Straud's movements are stiff, unyielding. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Once their game is concluded, Dexx motions to follow Straud inside the house. But he gives what ends up being the only vocalization from him in the 24h period: "Shoo!"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The dog runs off into the distance and isn't seen again in the projection.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud spends some time then staring over his many bookshelves, seeming to read the titles but never removes a book from the storage.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He spends some more time on his phone and then retreats into the basement, where the projection ends.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian has a pensive expression as the projection dissolves. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vlad was clearly distracted, almost anxious. I know he has a lot on his mind, but it is unusual for him to display it so openly..." A thought strikes Davian. "Where is that Fera, Ben? and where is Dex?" </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc steps up, feeling responsible for the dog that was once his. "Dexx isn't here... He usually comes to greet me when I visit the mansion..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You have had other things on your mind." I say reassuringly. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Turning my attention back to the group, "Where is Vlad's phone?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric answers. "Probably in the crypt, at his computer there. It's a good thought..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"All my thoughts are good. Mandarc, would you mind using your impressive speed to bring me the device?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Cedric, have you had any chance to probe the mind of our resident were-cat? He seemed to hold Vlad in high regard, and I can't help but notice that his disappearance coincides with this...incident."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Not... a problem, bossman. Can do, can do." Mandarc whizzes away, leaving in his wake disturbed air that fluffs Miriam's hair. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Certainly. Probably the best chance we have of tracking down the mutt as well." Cedric unfurls his arms and places one fingertip to his temple, as if attempting to soothe a headache.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>"Ben, are you out there? We need your help. Straud has fallen into torpor. We're at the Mansion. Please return."</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In a moment, Mandarc returns with a small cellphone in hand. It's a small flip device with manual buttons, like the devices Straud was accustomed to presenting to his unliving accomplices. Mandarc hands it over to Davian. "Can't say I know his password or anything like that..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thank you Mandarc; and you as well Cedric. Now let me see..." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian focuses his attention to the cellphone and begins to weave a pattern of effect from Correspondence, Matter, and Forces: Correspondence to access the data without opening or destroying the device, Matter and Forces to determine the location and encoding of the data within the physical memory of the phone.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The phone seems to welcome you, opening to a screen of icons indicating the applications installed on the phone. A dot below the title seems to state which programs are currently suspended, including a pdf viewer, a document composer, a messaging app...</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">With an small grunt of triumph, Davian begins to access the data, checking each open app in turn.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It appears the pdf viewer and document composer were working in tandem -- he was viewing a number of plays that he'd attributed to other sources, though you'd always suspected he was indeed the primary author... the document composer has a few paragraphs, but nothing you'd ordinarily attribute to his genius. The messaging app has open a chat he was having with Cedric concerning the Prince, Caleb, who you recall meeting at one of your parties in the spring.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As I review the material, a small frown begins to grow on my face. <i>Dead end.</i> </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Cedric, looks like you were having a discussion with Vlad regarding Caleb...he came to my soiree earlier in the year, correct?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">While I wait for his answer I make a quick google search of the paragraphs Straud had entered in the document composer.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric wears a serious expression on his face at the change in the conversation. "We were talking about Caleb...We're worried about him because he's fallen in with Trente Gagarin and seems to be withdrawing from our company. No matter what we do, he seems to be regarding us as the bad influences, rather than the other way around. Even to result in the exclusion of his sister. It's been something that's been troubling to all of us."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Trente, you'll recall, is a dear friend of Trelaine."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc seems to shudder at the mention of the name. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Your search on Straud's writing reveals possibly plagiarized phrases -- although you concede that he could be copying his own work. Is it really plagiarizing if you're using your own words?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I make a copy of the relevant texts into my notebook for further investigation. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He seemed a decent sort, if a bit feckless and easily influenced. Do you suppose Trente is influencing him through the use of Blood Magic..er sorry, 'Disciplines'?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"She's certainly capable of it, I would think, and being from Firsthome it's hard to say what she is capable of."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There's a pause in the room, half of the attention going toward Miriam, wondering if the old associate of Straud's has anything to add to the conversation. But she seems to shrug, if telepathically, as if she's unable to comment on the elephant in the room. But Mandarc pipes up, breaking the silence.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Can I just make a comment here? I respect the Master as much as the next guy, maybe even more so after he saved me from Lenard...But can we talk about this for a second? Do we really believe the tale that the Master is from another planet? I mean...he always talks about his origin obliquely, as if he's hiding something. Cedric, I know you're on board to believe him but couldn't it be possible that he was once a human? He walks, talks, and acts like someone who was born here, like us. Ancient beyond measure...I believe it to a point but to the point that he actually comes from another Earth-like planet, with humanoids like ourselves, that have also been cursed with vampirism...Miriam, you've known him longer than any of us here. What do you think? Do you really think he's an inter-dimensional traveler?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She hesitates, her face like a deer caught in headlights. "I...I really can't say. It would explain a lot of things..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"But it leaves so many more things unexplained!"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You know what they say," Cedric interjects. "Eliminate the impossible and what you're left with..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Oh shut up you smarmy fuck!" Mandarc has lost his cool. "I could even see him being some kind of creation of a Earth-bound deity -- that is something I could attempt to believe. Improbable, but maybe I could wrap my mind around it."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Why does it matter where he's from?" Miriam interrupts. "What matters is that he's here before us and we must help him."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I never said I didn't want to help him, but I'm also pursuant to the truth. And the explanation that he's a little green man from space doesn't seem the truth to me."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He changes his approach. "What say you, Davian? Have you ever met a man from the moon?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian stands and stares at each of them, eyebrow raised, a small smile on his face. "The moon? Depends on which side of the Veil." Davian's eyes fill their vision and for a brief moment the three are granted a vision: the kindly, foppish gentleman is replaced with a Dragon of Legend, power rippling off Indigo scales, eyes alight with wisdom. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As quickly as the vision came, it is gone, leaving a tall man in a stuffy, old-fashioned suit. "Straud's secrets are his to give, I will not speculate, but I find your lack of faith...disturbing." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The Master also speaks of the importance of this elusive Faith, but what use is Faith in the presence of Truth and Science? Even your magic is no longer imaginary when you work miracles into reality. If the Master came to me and told me he was from a foreign plane, I might believe it. Might. But as I see it now, he spins half-truths and makes implications as if he's trying to inspire goodness in us. No different than the mortals trying to invoke good behavior under the threat of Santa Claus's ever-present eye. I do not think he need be from another world, in fact I think perhaps it might be a greater tale if he weren't."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I keep hearing about this quasi-mythical Firsthome and how the three of them originate from there and it dilutes the idea that we Earthicans can do anything. As if we're just a stopping point on their quest to dominate the local habitable worlds. And I don't want to be that, I want to believe our world is special. I suppose that is my Faith, that we don't need extra-dimensional beings to fight their wars here for no one's benefit but their own. Trelaine was a frightening man, with little real concern for anyone outside those who stood to benefit him. I don't want to believe he and the Master have anything in common."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Suppose it's true, then, that this Firsthome really is another planet. We might need an army of mages to combat their comic book style rogues gallery. Because as it stands now we have one of Straud against how many of them?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Numbers don't mean shit when we have the homefield advantage. Besides, I have no reason to believe there's anything exceptional about the elves of Firsthome, excepting, of course, that they're naturally telepathic. That makes their entire culture and development different from what we can imagine."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He pauses for a moment. "And if my dreams aren't complete imagination, if they're rooted in the true vision of the Umbra...Then their technology is something to fear. But we have the ultimate weapon against technology, and that's our friends of Talent. Faith became science for me, Mandarc, when Davian brought my Master back to life. He was a spirit trapped inside a mortal's mind, and yet, there he was, standing again before us all. I think we should fear their magic, because of what magic can do by definition, but we should have faith in what our friends can do."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So Vlad may be the only good one in a terrifying race that squelches free expression and independent thought. It's foreboding but I think we can handle it. We're well on our way." He eyes Davian and the slightest smile spreads over his face. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"On that note, if we're still looking for the mutt and Ben is M.I.A., I think Vincent would be able to help us. His gifts include those others call "gangrel". He should be able to catch scent of the dog and find where he's gone."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I nod at some of Cedric and Mandarc's points, raising an eyebrow at others ('only advantage being naturally telepathic'). </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I sympathize with your desire to view earth as special, Mandarc, and it is - to you and everyone else who lives here. The value of your home is not diminished because you learn of the existence of other houses nor because you find friends to help you defend it from invaders (a nod to Cedric). "</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The issue of course, is how to defend the planet without destroying the consensus completely and causing absolute chaos. You both speak of Faith and Science as if they are separate things, but my experience with Magic has shown me otherwise. The shock of billions of souls suddenly realizing the truth and potentially Awakening...well, victory might be worse than defeat."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I will create a sending for Ben; if he cannot be found we will contact Vincent."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"For most," Cedric continues, "I fear the shock of Magic will be the end of Faith. They like the unknown, but mostly they like the unknowable. They like the farcical idea that all that separates them from the likes of Ian Dusk is a few handfuls of cash. When magic divides the haves from the have-nots, you're looking at the threat of revolution."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"And to be honest, I don't blame them. They have little comprehension of how unequal their world already is. When it is thrust in their face, that some mortals are little more than the world's cattle...It is then we will miss Faith."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"If we want the world's people to exist together in harmony, we will have to replace their Faith with something else. Did you ever meet Mikael? We will need more Awakenings like his, people with an inherent sense of justice and fairness. The people will want protection and it is people like him who will provide the face they are looking for."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes, the potential consequences have always been too high."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I have had the pleasure of meeting Mikael, a promising young man; in this age of pulp adventure and mass-market cinema he is a fitting ambassador, the wedge we might need. But I digress and Vlad remains. I will reach out to Ben now."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian settles into one of Straud's supremely comfortable wingback chairs and calms his mind, letting his consciousness wander. Expanding his perception, street by street, he is soon aware of all but the most shielded minds in New York and after a moment he finds what he is seeking in the middle of Central Park. <i>The Node, of course.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gently, Davian touches the mind of the Werepanther, letting him acknowledge the contact before 'speaking'. <i>Ben, this is Davian. You attended one of my Parties a little while back. I need you to return to the house immediately. Nixkamich natomuwal (Grandfather is in Peril)</i> </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There is a sensation of startled understanding and then two words. <i>I come.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Message completed, Davian reaches into his jacket pocket and removes a large joint from a platinum and gold cigarette case, which he lights with a snap of his fingers. After a deep drag, he motions to the other chairs around the fire. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ben will be here in a moment. Please sit and tell me every detail you know about Trelaine. Assume Vlad has been a cagey old mummy, I know that will be hard..." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric lets out a laugh before continuing. "Well, by the time I'd been converted in the late 90s, Trelaine was already enemy number one for my House. In 1995, he kidnapped the young Kevin Marscapone and performed a number of medical procedures during the captivity. His father, Vincent, rescued him and vowed revenge."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In the silence, Mandarc moves forward to fill the void. "Trelaine was my first master -- I don't remember much of my origins except broken dreams and shattered visions -- but when I did first to begin to discover my own mind, it was he who called me Childe."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"My early memories involve listing about the lab, yearning for his guidance. But he was usually nowhere to be found."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric interrupts. "You see, even after he left Vincent discorporated...He still held his rivalry close to his heart."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc recaptures the conversation. "He has outposts all over Brooklyn, but the main headquarters is what we call the Cathedral. When he's not practicing his medical arts: splicing up vampires; he has a deluded bunch of followers that cluster around this Cathedral. They are on the feral side of things, stalking humanity indiscriminately and taking whatever prey smells the best in the moment. He seems to want a group of mages to follow him to keep him safe in the Reveal, and we have no way of knowing how successful he's been on this goal so far."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The last we had intel, he was working on ensuring the loyalty of the daughter of the Tang family. He may also be...." Mandarc pauses, trying to find the right words.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric bursts in. "He's doing research on forcing the Awakening in mortal subjects. We found that he was stealing bone dust and distilling the magic that remains in the bodies of the deceased after their departure from our realm. It's...it's..." He clenches his fist in anger. "It's reprehensible, unforgivable. Our coterie swore him off once he declared war on the Marscapone house, but this theft...Makes it personal."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The Awakenings I remember discussing; a fool's errand even if successful, but he risks much more than himself. Whose dust does he now possess?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"There's no telling, he's covered his tracks that well. I can get you a list of names if you give me time to compile records...People who he was harvesting dust using his identity as a legal "practitioner" of medicine."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Please do; widen your net to include any report of stolen remains. Once we have a list, I can craft a Working."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'll get on it -- I have some folders of files relevant to our goals here, I just need to get a list of what we were working on." He turns on his phone and starts to thumb through its contents.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As Cedric steps away to hastily press commands into his phone, Mandarc steps up to where Davian is standing. "Forgive me," he begins, "but is there a way we can steal his research and use it for good? It seems to me that if the Awakenings weren't forced, they could be something we could use to bolster our side...Would any human not want to be elevated to something more powerful than they are?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I am definitely interested in obtaining his research, but only so I can ensure its destruction. Many Orders have thought of forcing Awakening...who wouldn't want more soldiers for their faction and, after all, we are doing them a favor..." Davian gives his head a small, sad shake "the results were monstrous. The mind has to be ready; there is no process to force Enlightenment."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Do you think there's some god driving this all? A god of Magic? There rarely seems to be oddity like this without there being reason behind it all." Mandarc seems genuinely interested in Davian's response.</p>

Yeah, I can lead you there, but I'm very aware of warding magicks they will have on the premises once we reach the gate. It's the same kind of magick they used to exclude Vincent after his repeated attacks against their properties...And him overcoming that...Well you know where that got him, so...They will have something set up to protect against my personage and unless you work some kind of mage-ery..."

<p class="ppl-sez">"There's a Chinese food store and restaurant, the Fat Rabbit, that acts as a front for the entrance into the sewer -- a small staircase to the basement level, all to mask an entrance to the sewer. From there there's some neutral zone for local informants and labor. But beyond that is the entrance to the cathedral." He pauses, as if to take a breath. "It's where anyone wanting to seek shelter within the Sabbat's walls might look to present oneself. But it's a low-class entrance, sort of like those used by underclassman, and the uppers don't like to be seen using it. Scrutiny may be tough, but so long as you present yourself as completely ordinary, sort of beyond notice...They like to present themselves as welcoming, a shelter for young vampires and other creatures of the night.

She was the most powerful being in her land, and people shook in her presence. They feared her when she was normal, and she came to crave the feeling. She summoned more creatures, but it was not enough."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Surely you're familiar with the Egyptian practice of mummifying the dead? Their ancients taught them that. Back in the time before we understood planes magick, they believed it was a backdoor to immortality. No one ever dreamed that the young would ingest the essence distilled in their corpses. It is one of the reasons we always recommend complete destruction of the dead. Cremation is the only acceptable means for disposing of the departed."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"She consumed not only bones, but also organs. All of it. It's too much to detail here..."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It was a danger to the world, what she did. She continued to summon great creatures of fear and war, until one day, she summoned the worst of them all."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I say it had the body of a demon, but I've never seen a demon before. I'd say it had the bloodthirsty nature of an injured wild boar, but thankfully the Circle dispatched any I've heard of. No, I can't say what exactly this terrible creature looked like, but it ate indiscriminately. It ran about the kingdom, frightening all who did not pay their proper respects to the queen."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The hologram that the book holds on is a bestial, bent creature, with hooves and claws, a terrible beak, and mottled, messy hair-like fur, matted with blood and dirt.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The creature ran rampant and the queen grew fatter and more contented with her empire of terror. Then one day, the queen, with little else to harvest, took to challenge the great beast for its magick. They fought a terrible fight, and her kingdom was all but destroyed, the queen devoured, the monster no where to be seen."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You see, there's a twofold lesson to be learned here. First, always destroy the bodies of the dead. It is Man's duty to curate his land and allow for the young things to flourish. To that end, we must destroy the old so that it may be given to the young. Second?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She stumbles over her recitation. "Second. Shit, the ink's run. I'm not sure what the second point is. Something about how there's always a bigger fish."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc breaks the silence.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So all we can do is stand around and wait for evil to destroy itself?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Best not to make a sound...</i> Cedric transmits telepathically to his company.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Lila uses a layered Forces effect to reassemble the visual space. <i>Agreed. The entrance is 200 yards ahead of us on the right. Probably best for me to transform us here, one moment.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila pauses, forcing herself to ignore the almost-physical stench of the gurgling sewage. Weaving Life, Matter, Prime, and Spirit, she transforms the three of them into Norwegian rats: One russet, one tuxedo, and one with a spot of white on its head.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Rat-Lila makes a barely audible squeak of dismay and holds up her slime covered paws <i>Let's get into that pipe.</i></p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The three of you skitter down the hallway, taking notice of how long it takes to make any appreciable distance, what with your size being what it is.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>D'ya think there're any crocs in that riverway?</i> Mandarc asks.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Let's not stay long enough to find out.</i> Cedric replies curtly.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You venture down the hallway, noting bits of trash and detritus that would have escaped notice on two legs. There are half-chewed bits of food as well; you're not the only rats in this cave.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Finally, matching the map to what you see in front of you, you take a careful look around and note the steady drip-drip-drip coming from above the water. All drips come from somewhere. You've found the pipe. But your rat-paws will not scale the rounded ceiling.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Well...rats. One second.</i> Lila extends her senses up the pipe, 'looking' for the resonance of a Ward or active spell effect nearby.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Your senses brighten, spreading to the area as you close your eyes and fill your consciousness with the sense of 3D space.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">An unknown magical aura begins above your head, somewhere where the ceiling ends and the basement begins. The pipe seems clear, but as it travels into the building, it becomes fuzzy...</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Alright. The Wards don't extend down through the ceiling; I should be able to pull off a little trick without anyone noticing.</i> Lila makes a strange gesture with her paws and a beautifully enameled metal skateboard appears on the ground next to the party.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila hops onto the deck and takes a seat <i>Accio Firebolt.</i> </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Hop on and it'll take us to the pipe.</i></p>

<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The two vampire-rats scurry onto the skateboard's surface.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Hold on to your butts.</i> Mandarc comments as they get situated.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila sticks her tongue out as the skateboard rises into the air; once it reaches the pipe it hovers in place. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Thank you for flying Southpest Air, mind your step while disembarking</i> Lila waits until Cedric and Mandarc are safe before leaping into the pipe behind them, skateboard defragmenting into lines of code before transitioning back into the Digital Web. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Alright squeakhearts, forward march.</i></p>
