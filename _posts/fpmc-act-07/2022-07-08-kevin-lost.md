### // OLD GALANTOME ESTATE //

<BR><I>It was my duty to take the Count to Cassandra's home to deliver the news. We walked over to her home and knocked on the door.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> KEVIN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
> 
> PLEASE COME IN.

<BR><I>It was good to hear her voice again in the face of loss.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
> 
> LUCIA IS DEAD.
> 
> SHE WAS ATTACKED BY A FERAL WEREWOLF.

<BR><I>Vladislaus Straud stepped into the entrance.</i>

#### STRAUD

> SHE HAD FOLLOWED ME TO AN UNSAFE PLACE.

#### KEVIN

> THIS IS VLADISLAUS STRAUD, A FRIEND WHO WAS THE LAST ONE WHO SPOKE TO HER.

<BR><I>Cassandra stares off into space.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> I DON'T UNDERSTAND...SHE'S REALLY GONE?

#### STRAUD

> SHE ASKED TO BE TAKEN TO THE OCEAN.

<BR><I>Cassandra yells into the house.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> LARRY!!
> 
> COULD YOU COME DOWN HERE PLEASE?

<BR><I>Soon, Larry descends the stairs. He refuses to speak until he's within a comfortable speaking distance from us.</i>

#### LARRY

> KEVIN.
> 
> ...COUNT STRAUD.

<BR><I>Cassandra has little time for Larry's chilly attitude.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> LARRY...LUCIA IS GONE. SHE WAS ATTACKED.

<BR><I>The news hits Larry's mind. He puffs up in rage.</i>

#### LARRY

> WHAT DID YOU DO?!

<BR><I>He aims his aggression at Kevin.</i>

<i>But the Count has other intentions.</i>

#### STRAUD

> KEVIN WAS NOT THERE.
> 
> THIS IS MY FAULT.

<BR><I>Larry was reluctant to reflect his anger at the Count. He paused for a moment, then seemed to look at the floor.</i>

#### LARRY

> HOW COULD YOU HAVE FAILED HER?

#### STRAUD

> I WAS ILL-PREPARED.

<BR><I>Larry responds with cold silence, then speaks.</i>

#### LARRY

> IS IT OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND HER FAMILY AND NOTIFY THEM?

#### STRAUD.

> NO.
> 
> WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

<BR><I>The room sinks into inky quiet.</i>

#### CASSANDRA

> WAS SHE ACTUALLY A PRINCESS?

#### STRAUD

> THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION, CASSANDRA.
> 
> SHE TRULY WAS A PRINCESS OF A PRESTIGIOUS NOR' YEUROPEAN FAMILY THAT HAD DISTILLED A QUALITY MAGICKING BLOODLINE. 
> 
> BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED BECAUSE OF THE WEAKNESSES SUCH A BLOODLINE'S MAINTENANCE ENTAILS.
> 
> I SUSPECT SHE'D BEEN POSSESSED BY A SPECTER ORIGINATING FROM THIS HOME.
> 
> HER BEHAVIOR WAS IRRATIONAL. VERY UNLIKE HER.
> 
> SHE FOLLOWED ME OUT-OF-TOWN. I TRIED TO PERSUADE HER TO LEAVE BUT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE IT.

#### LARRY

> YOU THINK SHE WAS BEING POSSESSED?

#### STRAUD

> I HAVE NO BETTER IDEA.
> 
> DO YOU HAVE CONFLICTING EVIDENCE?

#### LARRY

> NO, SHE WAS BEHAVING STRANGELY BUT I HAD THOUGHT HER STRENGTH OF SOUL WOULD PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.

#### STRAUD

> SHE WAS STRONG OF SOUL BUT THIS MAY BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY TENACIOUS SPIRIT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
> 
> I DON'T HAVE ANY FIRM PROOF THAT IT WAS A SPECTER BUT THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED, IS IT NOT?
> 
> DOES IT NOT LIE WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY THAT A COLLECTION OF SOUL STUFF WENT ROGUE?

#### LARRY

> I SUPPOSE IT IS POSSIBLE.

#### CASSANDRA

> I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S REALLY GONE.

#### STRAUD

> SHE WAS TAKEN BEFORE HER TIME.

<BR><I>Anger wells up in Larry and he quickly erupts at the Count.</i>

#### LARRY

> THIS IS YOUR FAULT! 
> 
> YOU DIDN'T PROTECT HER!

#### STRAUD

> SHE FOLLOWED ME TO AN UNSAFE LOCATION.

#### LARRY

> YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

#### STRAUD

> WHAT, YOU WANTED ME TO REACH INTO THE INNER RECESSES OF HER MIND AND COMMAND HER TO LEAVE?

#### LARRY

> IF THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED HER LIFE!

#### STRAUD

> PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE.

#### CASSANDRA

> SIR?

#### STRAUD

> YES, CASSANDRA?

#### CASSANDRA

> PERHAPS THAT ISN'T WHAT LUCIA WOULD HAVE WANTED.
> 
> MAYBE SHE DIED DOING WHAT SHE FELT SHE OUGHT TO DO.
