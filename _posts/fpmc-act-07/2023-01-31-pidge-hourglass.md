<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A day passes in silence. Straud meditates through the high sun and receives an idea on what he's going to do. He was fairly certain that no one had noticed his absence, and if they had, one night was easy enough to wave away. What wasn't so easy was that he'd spent much longer than a night in torpor and he felt <i>different</i>. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The waking had been difficult. He'd been happy to realize that he'd been dreaming but the cessation...the immediate call. And as he looked back on it, the dream faded into memory like sand through the grip of an hourglass. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As the sun begins to set, he sits on the couch opposite the fireplace. Dexx comes up to him and affectionately lays his head upon his knee, begging for reassurance. He pets the dog, scratching those tender spots he just can't reach. But he only has time for a couple of pets -- the night approaches and he has much to do.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Every member of the coterie, and even those on the periphery, receive the following message.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>The Blue Velvet presents</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i><b>LONG WINTER</b></i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>by Bianca Vacarescu</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i><b>TONIGHT, ONE NIGHT ONLY</b></i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>seating begins at 8 PM, curtain at 9 PM</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian receives the gilt-embossed notice and smiles before handing it over to Lila. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Looks like I'm treating you to a show. Be ready for 6, I'd like to have a drink or two with the Old Man prior to the performance."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In a brick townhome in Steinway, adjacent to the Magicademy, Cedric receives the notice via email. "Did you see this, AVAEL? Do you want to go?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I cannot leave the house unattended. Someone needs to stay back. I can perform protective measures as needed for the block."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I know we should be wary of counter-attacks but now is a time to celebrate. Come on, the cats will be fine."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I will only slow you down." she concedes.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Not really." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Give me an hour to think about it."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc, having slumbered the day away at Widowshild, rises at his Master's message. His dark eyes run over the words, piecing together the intent behind the summons.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He dresses solemnly, ensuring no thread is out of place, and runs up the hill to Straud Mansion.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">When he gets there, he is surprised to find the door open. He walks in and is accosted by Dexx, who greets him warmly. "Good boy! Glad to see you back home!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes." Straud enters the foyer from the sitting room. "He returned in the early morning hours. I hope he will be alright sitting in the house alone for several hours."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He did come back home. Maybe that's just what he wants." Mandarc pauses a moment. "Shall I drive you to the B.V.?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm ready to go." Straud and Mandarc step out onto the stoop. Straud locks the door behind them. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Parked out in front of the house is a black car, something that seems like a familiar emblem but isn't quite the same. It's a foreign make, perhaps. But it's dark and doesn't attract a lot of attention. Mandarc sits in the front seat and Straud climbs into the back.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You should read the book's manual at some point. And perhaps a general book about maintaining a car." Straud comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A mundane book, sir?" Mandarc flicks his eyes between the mirror and the road. "Isn't that what mages are for?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Just because a mage is capable of great things is no excuse for <b>you</b> to be lazy."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Fair enough."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The pair rides to the B.V. in mostly silence, Mandarc focused on the road, Straud focused on observing the city around him. Somehow he could feel the void left by the death the night before. A weight was lifted, so many wayward souls freed to wander where they would. He was glad those followers would not be with Trelaine during the challenges ahead.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Traffic be damned, they reach the B.V., allow Frankie to park the car, and walk into the familiar establishment.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/alexandervongalen.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ALEXANDER//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Alexander sits in a dim corner of the 'Blue Velvet', looking around the room with cold detachment. <i>Well appointed nightclub. So far little more.</i> He takes a sip of his drink every so often, to keep up appearances, which is the only movement he makes. He notes the bustle the arrival of the silver-haired man produces. <i>Interesting. The Boss.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud surveys the room noting the auras present. <i>Several supernaturals, even more mundanes, calm, easy-going emotions. Keep the drinks rolling and we'll have a loyal crowd for hours.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud disappears into the back of the stage, presumably to deliver some last minute notes to the performers. They'll be reviewing their parts over the next hours to prepare for the last-minute announcement of the debut. But they knew better than to question what was asked of them.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc sits alone at the reserved table at the far left of the stage. Matilda knows to bring him a plasma jane and leave him alone until the rest of the party arrives.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ！NE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ（ne enters the BV confidently, dressed in a keyhole-top, slit leg Qipao in crimson, her hair swirling around her like a living force. Upon seeing Mandarc she waves and makes her way over to the table. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Evening Mandarc."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"ﾃ（ne!" He puts down his drink, almost slamming it to the tabletop. "Nice to see you, I wasn't expecting anyone so early." He scoots over as if to allow ﾃ（ne space at the square booth, but the fact is that there's plenty.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Can I get you something?" He changes his mind, stands, and calls the waitress from across the moderately crowded room. "One of the usual?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ！NE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ（ne takes a seat, amused at Mandarc's awkward sincerity. Yes, thank you Mandarc...make it a double."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian tries not to focus on Lila's driving as they make their way down 21st street in his Flecked Indigo Corniche Convertible, but breathes an audible sigh of relief when they pull up to the BV. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Let's get inside, I need a drink."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila's answering laugh sparkles with amusement "The man who stood unflinching in front of a God struggles with youthful driving?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thunderbird did not endanger my car."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Entering the club Davian spies Mandarc and raises his cane in response, and the two Magi amble over to the booth.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Greetings Mandarc, ﾃ（ne. How are you both? Looking forward to the performance? Straud always puts on a good show."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila sneaks a glance around the room while Davian makes his introductions, her gaze lingering on ﾃ（ne's dress. <i>Oh my...I wonder who is meant to see...</i> Turning back to the crowd, she cannot help but feel a thrill of excitement for her first bit of Theatre in NYC, even if it is in Astoria.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc makes his way back to the table with two double plasma janes in hand. He places the drinks on the table and pushes them over the wooden surface.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I guess I oughta make my way back to the bar. Welcome welcome Davian and Lila. What can I get the evening star and her Magister?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Very Kind of you Mandarc; a Peach Julep please. Lila?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Rusty Nail. With real Scotch...there is no 'e' in Whisky." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes sir, and ma'am." Mandarc disappears with their drink orders.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">When he reappears, he bears both drinks, filled to heaping, and hasn't spilt a drop. He places the drinks on the table. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc rejoins them at the bar and leads everyone in a toast. "To early risers and those who like to stay out late. Lila, Davian, ﾃ（ne... Cheers!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian raises his glass, making sure to give Lila the first toast. "Hear Hear! I would like to raise a toast to my Apprentice, who has shown remarkable initiative and similar temperament. To Lila Black, the Scottish Dragon!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Hip hip!" Mandarc joins in the cheer. <i>I'm just glad I saw it, even if it was from the back of the room.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They are just finishing their hurrahs when, at the head of the stage, out slips Straud. He surveys the room, noting changes and lack thereof in the crowd. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Drawing his attention is a shifter, which on its own would have been peculiar enough, but this one was...could he be correct in seeing a Naga?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He would keep his eye on this one. Why had he come here?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">When Straud comes back to the the table, he can sense he's missed a toast. "My apologies, my friends, I was just giving some last minute notes to the cast of tonight's presentation. It's a new one and we're trying to get it just right. They're reviewing the changes now, and working with costuming, and they'll be ready for curtain. My time is now yours. What have I missed?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Vlad, welcome. I was just giving Lila another well-deserved toast. Mandarc has been the perfect host in your absence."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion strides into the BV, carelessly pushing past the hoi poloi, his violet eyes searching the room. Seeing her, he smiles, and quickens his pace, arriving at the table before he can be noticed. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Count, it is an honor, thank you for the invitation. A pleasure to see you again Magister. Hello Lila, Mandarc." Finally he turns to ﾃ（ne: "My Lady." She offers her hand and he smiles, bending to kiss the velvet skin.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To ﾃ（ne  <i>Girl. Now I get the dress.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ！NE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ（ne catches Lila's eyes as Gwydion gets settled and winks languidly.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To ﾃ（ne: <i>Making yourself at home, granddaughter?</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ！NE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To Straud <i>Making connections with the Magi of New York. I hear his Mother was a big deal before she disappeared. His dark, mysterious nature and brooding good looks have nothing to do with it...</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">To ﾃ（ne: <i>Perhaps this will be good for the both of you. Will it give you a reason to stick around this time?</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ﾃ！NE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>I was young, and impatient. And perhaps more than a little headstrong. The Embrace left me with nothing...so being a Vampire meant everything. You were only trying to help me Grandfather...but perhaps every child needs to rebel. Baba sends her regards by the way; nothing has changed, but the rift between you is a wound.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>It may be soon time to seek reconciliation with Baba Yaga. But for now, I must focus my efforts at home.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>You have gained much in your time away. I am not angry; I am becoming sentimental. I am sorry that my charge left you with so little guidance. It is something I have lamented...If only I had known, if only I had been wiser. But you have learned much. Welcome back, my Childe.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As Gwydion settles into his seat, he catches the faint whispers of mental communication; if he concentrated he could listen in, but such things hardly fit the current setting. Besides, from the expression on ﾃ（ne's face and the position of Straud's head, this conversation was personal. Stretching out in the booth (so his leg just so happened to touch ﾃ（ne's) , he catches a server's eye. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A traditional Sazerac please, double."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mm-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIKAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mikael pauses for a moment at the entrance, the memory of his last experience at the Blue Velvet replaying in his head. <i>Hard to believe that was only a few months ago.</i> He unconsciously smooths his silk jacket then straightens and steps through the door, keeping an eye out for familiar faces.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Behind Mikael comes a familiar face, another blond, but this one with a pale scar running down his face. Cedric calls out, "Hey Kal-El!" </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">When you turn around, you see Cedric and a man you don't recognize. He's gaunt but tall, thin muscles seeming to drape off an oversized skeleton. He has a kind face, patient and discerning, framed by a short flash of rusty orange hair. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric motions to introduce him. "This is my friend Kevin Marscapone. His family runs a school for mages here in Astoria." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin waves genially. "Greetings greetings."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric turns back to Mikael. "So you got the invite, too, huh? Bossman's got a lot to celebrate. Long story, I'm sure you'll hear it more than once tonight. It's good to see you again. Want to sit with us tonight?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc notices Gwydion, very quiet, very focused on ﾃ（ne. There was something mysterious about him, something hidden. He knew he was a mage, but something seemed darker about him. He was not quite like Davian or Lila.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc takes out his phone and sends a text message to Yuki Behr. She was part of the herd of mortals that always found themselves hanging out around the supernaturals of the Blue Velvet. Day to day, she managed the speakeasy's web-presence, a job Straud had intended for Friday Perkins, but had later given to Yuki.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She responds and the two begin texting back and forth, distracting Mandarc from the chatter at the table.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">After Straud and ﾃ（ne finish their conversation, Straud leans over to Davian. He points out the strange shifter across the room.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>What do you make of that man?</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mm-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIKAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mikael turns and flashes a relieved smile and holds out his hand to both men. "Cedric, good to see you; Kevin, pleasure. Thank would be great, I was surprised to receive Mr. Straud's invitation...glad he doesn't hold any hard feelings."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian surreptitiously examines the lithe figure in the shadows, using a bit of Forces, Life, and Mind. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>A Shifter, but something more. His Aura is chaotic and I detect something like awakening, but incomplete. A Shifter Sleepwalker? Now that is a special snowflake.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A little hole in the wall is no biggie." Cedric boasts. "I'm just glad you found our hideout. It's good to have you back again."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The trio walks over to the booth where the party is seated. Though it appears to be full as it's installed into the wall, the seating never seems to run out and no one ever has to be crammed in next to their neighbor.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Everyone, this is Mikael Martel, a guest of ours from late summer. He helped dispatch Lindsay and Jack one night they were messing with our fun."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The group greets the young man and invites him to sit down. Straud is careful to extend a warm welcome to Mikael, remembering the fraught event at which he was brought into the fold. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>We should greet the man. I find individuals do not usually find themselves here for no reason.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian continues to covertly examine the stranger while communicating with Straud. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Agreed. The Naga have long been thought to be extinct; for one to show up on the day of your performance seems more than coincidental. How would you like to proceed? Introductions at his table might make him feel threatened, but so might an invitation to our motley crew.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>We shall make our presence known and extend a welcome. Come with me, I do not want to scare him off with too stern an expression.</i> </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud and Davian motion to get up, but something about this enchanted booth keeps working its magic. He doesn't have to ask anyone to get up, rather, he just finds himself exactly where he wants to be; on the outside of the table. Matilda runs by with drinks; she's harried, the night is beginning to pick up.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The pair approach the table with the strange man who's been eyeing them. Straud bows politely. "Welcome, sir, to the Blue Velvet. I happen to own this establishment and noticed that you're a newcomer tonight. Did you happen in or are you here for the special performance of <i>Long Winter</i>?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">ALEXANDER//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Xander tenses as the two men rise from their seats, their eyes fixed on his location. His arcane senses identified the dark-haired man in the elegant suit as a Mage of awesome power, but the silver-haired gentlemen confused him. The BV was rumored to be owned by an ancient Vampire, but this man was seemed like no other vampire Xander had ever encountered...he smelled different, and he emanated a peculiar aura. Regardless, these two were power-players. <i>Remember: you don't really know what happened.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Xander rises and follows the owner's (Strahd? Straud!) choice of greeting, making a small bow to each man:</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Alexander von Galen. Thank you, Mr. Straud. I must admit to ulterior motives for my visit, but now that I am here, the show looks intriguing. I have often heard of this place...I have many friends who lead an active night life."</p>

The locals have taken to calling it Elysium, but I like to think of Elysium as something we will be someday, rather than something we are today."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud tries to maintain a calm hand on the conversation. It was like lion-taming, trying to ensure that they don't spook the newcomer. What would Ben make of this man?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"This is my companion Davian Hughes." He gestures to the dark-haired man. "He's a gentleman of many talents and a dear friend of mine. Perhaps you will join us at our table? The view is spectacular."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez"><i>I hesitate to tell him what being a parishioner of Trelaine's generally entails. At the very least, let's be delicate.</i></p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian Hughes, Archmage and Magister of the Order of Hermes, pleasure to make your acquaintance. The actions of the Order are none of your concern; however, in the interest of ecumenical understanding I will tell you that Trelaine had something he shouldn't have, so we took it back; with some collateral damage."

<p class="ppl-sez">He resumes talking to Gwydion. "I hope all goes well for her." It is brief, but genuine. Aegwynn was practically a household name for supernaturals in the City.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The already dim lights fade until the only light in the room are the spotlights on the stage. The crowd goes silent as all eyes shift from their tables to the stage. It is almost unbelievable that this room, filled with bodies supernatural and mundane, could be so otherworldly quiet.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The curtain is drawn and there is a woman in a long purple dress. Her name is Pamela and she is introduced as a farmer in a future dystopia where everyone has been driven underground due to a nuclear disaster. But life is not all bad, in fact, the woman is rather happy with her lot in life. Right now she's concerned with her love for a fellow farmer, a man named Anton.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She cannot focus on her work, she cannot innovate in her position because she is so infatuated with Anton. But in their collective, marriage cannot occur until they are twenty years of age. And Anton intends on obeying the law.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cut to a parallel scene, a young diplomat is singing about a reversed situation; he's betrothed to a woman he has no interest in. He wants to be free and go on dates with many beautiful women. It's a fun romp, with many females in ornate costumes taking turns to join him and provide the soprano to his tenor.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">We get the sense that the two will be brought together as the head of the pod prepares to announce a festival celebrating high yields by the farmers.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And then there's the drop. An alien woman is attending the party. And she's interested in a magician who just so happens to be in town. It's an obvious allusion to a famous sci-fi series but for the uninformed it does represent a departure for the work.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You hear murmurs of confusion among the more pedestrian of the Mundane. "An alien?!" They whisper furiously. But the woman's performance is the highlight of the act; she has an incredible singing voice. Her back and forth with her love interest at the festival forms the pivotal moment, blending into a reprisal of the young people's early performances.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But then, something strange happens. The lights go out. In an underground living hub, this is a halt to all life on the station. Because a party is going on, there happen to many candles around, so everyone takes a candle. This scene goes together with the audience each receiving a tea light as well.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cue curtain for intermission.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Turning his head, he sees Mikael and Cedric chatting with the Shifter, Alex. <i>Strange he should come tonight, but perhaps Straud's gifts are drawing others into the circle.</i></p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian gives a low chuckle. "I always wondered at that little bit of trivia, seemed a bit meta, you know?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Taking another deep drink, Davian looks across the table once again, letting the quiet of the moment wash over him. <i>So much had happened since he decided to come down for a quick visit mere months ago...</i>The light flash, alerting patrons to return to their seats. Davian finishes his drink then waves his hand over the glass; it is refilled. "No need to bother Matilda, she's working hard enough."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">One last  glance across the assembled faces before settling into his chair <i>The players are gathered. Now for act II.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As if at the bell, Mandarc reappears in a burst of speed and rejoins the booth. No one seems to pay any mind to him. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Act II opens on Pamela, who sings a very touching number that not only details the reasons for her love for Anton, but also tearfully addresses growing up and the passage of time. When it is seen at the end of the song that Anton no longer loves her, we feel for her, but know something is wrong by the way Anton acts suddenly changed in the recent darkness of the station. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The young diplomats are forced to work together despite feeling intense hatred for each other. They have realized they can get the lights back on if they provide startup energy for a backup generator that has been unmanned for years. Providing the startup energy, luckily enough for them, involves providing manpower through a set of stationary bicycles. (How fortunate!) But it's going to take nearly an hour of biking. (How unfortunate.)</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The alien sings a lovely love song for her beloved. But although the magician is won over by her charm in some ways, he has already promised himself to another, and does not intend to break his word. It's a bit of information we haven't had so far, but the magician is presented sympathetically and we're all-together just sad about the situation. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The doctor rushes into the scene and breaks to speak, instead of sing. He says that he suspects the alien is giving off pheromones that are making the inhabitants of the pod behave in strange ways, especially romantically. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Next, the point of view switches to see everyone at once, and they acknowledge that this festival was not going as planned, and rather, not going well at all. It confirms the suspicions that the root cause is the alien woman who has since visited the station, and was possibly due to her age. She concludes with a sad bit about how sad it is to get old.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She decides to leave the station and sings a tearful goodbye to the magician, who has come to appreciate her as a good friend. But she must leave.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And as soon as she does, the problem between Pamela and Anton are lifted. The lights flicker to life thanks to the diplomats, reaching the critical power to launch the generator. And the two reconcile, feeling renewed in having shifted their focus to helping the pod. And the performance ends with just a few short lines from the alien woman, who steals the show with a lot of feeling packed in very few notes. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The crowd erupts into applause and the players bow several times over.</p>

In no rush, he returns to his seat as the curtain calls end, immediately reaching for his cigarette case to light a perfect joint, the smoke disappearing almost as soon as it appears. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The second act was even more satisfying than the first, and the actors have had their worthy reward. Perhaps a few words from the Host of the Evening before everyone departs?"</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At a moment's thought, Straud is at the edge of the booth and standing. He opens his coat and removes a set of notecards from his breast pocket. He walks to the stage, past the table of the Camarilla leadership, and weaving through the floor seats. After ascending the side stairs, he takes center stage, now cleared and curtain reset. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Good evening, my friends, and thank you for attending tonight's performance of <i>Long Winter</i>. The tale has been long in the planning, but patient for the right place and time. Thank you again to Bianca Vacarescu for bringing me the original draft."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He motions to her in the crowd and she stands up, spotlight now upon her, and takes a bow. The audience claps enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Credit given to the writer, the light shines upon Straud once again. "But in all seriousness, a lot of you came here tonight filled with uncertainty about tonight's topic. Why an alien and a magician? Why romance? Why the whimsy? But I tell you, it is now we need whimsy more than ever. In these dark times, we must look forward with hope toward the future, a future that is shrouded in the richness that comes from an intensely mysterious world. There are those who would seek to destroy the wilderness, subdue it and enslave it to serve their twisted will. Who is the enemy in your life? Is it capitalism? Traditional currency? Or maybe it's not something, but someone. If you have cleared your conscience and know your way to be true, maybe it falls to you to be brave and not suffer trespass."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"But I digress," Straud continues. "We are dedicated to upholding the ideals of Elysium here and celebrate freedom from violence and persecution. We hope the rest of the world will follow our example and stop the pattern of bloodshed among our peoples. The time may come that we must band together as one. Would we still fight our brothers if a greater evil rose from the depths?" </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"The citizens of the pods had many things in common, and came to express empathy for their fellow man over the course of the play. They each had to deal with setback and eventually push through to make progress. They had to think about others besides themselves to make change. It's a struggle to which we all can relate. One good decision can make all the difference, which we see in the alien's decision to leave the station. I brought you all together to witness this to thank you for your compassion and loyalty and hope that we can continue holding hands to see the future come to fruition. Thank you."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Tomas is one of the first to stand and start clapping; a gesture meant to indicate his agreement to enter into alliance.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The rest of the audience starts to clap as well, and Straud leaves the stage to the roar of applause. It continues for a little while, and then tapers off, fading into the din of scattered chatter as the people begin to shuffle out of the theatre.</p>
