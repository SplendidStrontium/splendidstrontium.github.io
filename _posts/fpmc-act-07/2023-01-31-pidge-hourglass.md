<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">A day passes in silence. Straud meditates through the high sun and receives an idea on what he's going to do. He was fairly certain that no one had noticed his absence, and if they had, one night was easy enough to wave away. What wasn't so easy was that he'd spent much longer than a night in torpor and he felt <i>different</i>. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The waking had been difficult. He'd been happy to realize that he'd been dreaming but the cessation...the immediate call. And as he looked back on it, the dream faded into memory like sand through the grip of an hourglass. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As the sun begins to set, he sits on the couch opposite the fireplace. Dexx comes up to him and affectionately lays his head upon his knee, begging for reassurance. He pets the dog, scratching those tender spots he just can't reach. But he only has time for a couple of pets -- the night approaches and he has much to do.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Every member of the coterie, and even those on the periphery, receive the following message.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>The Blue Velvet presents</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i><b>LONG WINTER</i></b></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>by Bianca Vacarescu</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i><b>TONIGHT, ONE NIGHT ONLY</i></b></p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>seating begins at 8 PM, curtain at 9 PM</i></p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian receives the gilt-embossed notice and smiles before handing it over to Lila. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Looks like I'm treating you to a show. Be ready for 6, I'd like to have a drink or two with the Old Man prior to the performance."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In a brick townhome in Steinway, adjacent to the Magicademy, Cedric receives the notice via email. "Did you see this, AVAEL? Do you want to go?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I cannot leave the house unattended. Someone needs to stay back. I can perform protective measures as needed for the block."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I know we should be wary of counter-attacks but now is a time to celebrate. Come on, the cats will be fine."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I will only slow you down." she concedes.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Not really." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-finetb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Give me an hour to think about it."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc, having slumbered the day away at Widowshild, rises at his Master's message. His dark eyes run over the words, piecing together the intent behind the summons.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He dresses solemnly, ensuring no thread is out of place, and runs up the hill to Straud Mansion.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">When he gets there, he is surprised to find the door open. He walks in and is accosted by Dexx, who greets him warmly. "Good boy! Glad to see you back home!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes." Straud enters the foyer from the sitting room. "He returned in the early morning hours. I hope he will be alright sitting in the house alone for several hours."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He did come back home. Maybe that's just what he wants." Mandarc pauses a moment. "Shall I drive you to the B.V.?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm ready to go." Straud and Mandarc step out onto the stoop. Straud locks the door behind them. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Parked out in front of the house is a black car, something that seems like a familiar emblem but isn't quite the same. It's a foreign make, perhaps. But it's dark and doesn't attract a lot of attention. Mandarc sits in the front seat and Straud climbs into the back.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You should read the book's manual at some point. And perhaps a general book about maintaining a car." Straud comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"A mundane book, sir?" Mandarc flicks his eyes between the mirror and the road. "Isn't that what mages are for?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Just because a mage is capable of great things is no excuse for <b>you</b> to be lazy."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc-fine-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Fair enough."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The pair rides to the B.V. in mostly silence, Mandarc focused on the road, Straud focused on observing the city around him. Somehow he could feel the void left by the death the night before. A weight was lifted, so many wayward souls freed to wander where they would. He was glad those followers would not be with Trelaine during the challenges ahead.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Traffic be damned, they reach the B.V., allow Frankie to park the car, and walk into the familiar establishment.</p>
