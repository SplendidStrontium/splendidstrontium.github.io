<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Miriam removes her phone from her pocket and notes the time. 9:22 PM, Jan 30, 2022. It is 45 outside, overcast, almost drizzly. The year has gone without snow.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She had been looking over the tree encyclopedia given to her by one of the scurrying imps. But she closes it, her attention wavering. She sits in the chair, chilled in sorrow. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>You know, it's true that our kind, that is to say, the Vampire, is prone to fits of sleep of even years at a time, but to put one asleep against his will is truly an unforgivable offense.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian stares into the fire, waiting for Ben to return. Their plan held little risk, at least physically, but Davian is uncharacteristically nervous. <i>I'm used to being in control; running the show. Not at the mercy of someone else...even Ben.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He glances over at Miriam, surprised to see her shrunken into herself, vulnerable. <i>But then, her Lord and Mentor lies insensate. </i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Miriam, what was that book Lila's imp gave you?" </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Something calming. An identification guide to North American trees. I've only just returned recently and I was stunned to see that Straud has so many friends. It is good, I think you will be able to do something to help him. I am so glad; in the old times, he wandered alone. For so many years... I think he was afraid of hurting those he cared about."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Power attracts problems. I cannot claim as many years as I suspect Vlad possesses, but I have lost much, suffered much due to my Awakening. I have no regrets, but it becomes easier to be alone. Not better, but easier."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian gives her a warm smile "Thankfully there are those stubborn and loyal enough to worm their way past his defenses."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He needs protection, now more than ever. It is startling to think how much time he spent wandering alone. It is good that this did not happen during those times."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She closes her eyes. "I will stay here until he wakes. I am prone to wanderlust, but let it be put aside for now. It is the least I can do after all he has done for me."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian nods and turns back to the fire, satisfied that some of Miriam's dolor had evaporated.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Moments later, there is a rustle outside and then Ben is striding into the room, lambent eyes focused.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/benjamin.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">BEN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I have all that I need; it was trivial to find these things even in this...desert. The fire will be helpful, let us prepare."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Moving chairs like children's toys, Ben piles them over in the corner next to the coffee table while Davian wisely rolls up the carpet with a twirl of his finger, leaving the bare stone exposed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Ben sits gracefully in front of the fire and unties the pouch from his belt, removing each reagent separately. Motioning to Davian to sit next to him, he begins to draw a series of images between himself and the fire: abstract symbols and glyphs as well as pictograms. It takes several minutes, but eventually Davian and Ben are surrounded by a circle of these drawings.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It is time. Miriam; you may stay, but do not engage the Spirit; without the protection and appeasement of my circle, I cannot promise your safety."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'll stay back unless I am needed."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"What would you have me do, Askuwheteau?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/benjamin.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">BEN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I do not know how you practice your Magic, Davian, but be open to your Source, your Gnosis. Most spirits that travelers encounter have once been mortal; their memory of that time creates a connection that helps them to understand and be understood. This spirit is Ancient. Old when my people first came to Turtle Island, it is powerful, wise, and capricious; and it seldom communicates with beings such as us."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">With that, Ben begins to chant in a sonorous rhythm. He lights a clay lamp in front of him and uses its flame to ignite a bundle of herbs. Once the herbs have caught completely, he snuffs the flame by bringing the wrap down into a bowl of salt and uses the smoke to trace flowing designs in the air that hang in front of the fire rather than dissipate. The designs begin to move, slowly forming a ring around the fire. Ben stops singing and there is an expectant pressure in the air.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There is no sound when the Thunderbird appears on this plane. There is only the scent of storm, of trees wet, of heavy clouds saturated with rain. The incense is snuffed out by a burst of wind and the nearby candles flicker.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Askuwheteau, last of your kin. I know why you have summoned me. I see this house, this plane, this world. This being your friends call Straud dwells in a shadow that stretches across the cosmos. You are not the only one who has an interest in his fate. Speak quickly to sway my favor; I do not intend to tarry long in this foreigner's home." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/benjamin.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">BEN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Askuwheteau bows from the waist, his forehead touching the floor. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Honored One, Cloud Dancer, Stormlord - I humbly ask your guidance: the Shadow deepens, enemies stir, and I smell death on the wind. Straud has been a true friend to The People, sacrificing his own for us and our future; now he is in need, and I fear that we shall need his strength in the struggle to come."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You will have my strength, do not forget that, Thunderwalker. As for the man from another world, I cannot interfere with these squabbles. Do not struggle in the quicksand. Remember your own strength."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"But I know you, little one. You are not easily dissuaded. It is true that the foreigner has treated my people with respect and consideration beyond what I had expected. This enchantment that's been placed on him is something even the Incanter may find impossible to simply dispel."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"His kind is strange to us but I have learned a little about them. You may be able to rouse him from torpor by speaking his True Name in his native tongue, a telepathic pattern more akin to a computer's binary than speech. No ordinary man may utter the syllables, nor would your mage so easily grok such a foreign speech. But -- There is one near you who may be inspired to this capability. He is half human but perhaps the knowledge can be coaxed from his ancestral memories. His name is Emmitt Skinner, a young boy rescued by Straud from the hands of Gagarin and her coterie. As for where you may find someone who knows your friend's True Name, I leave that up to you."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/benjamin.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">BEN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thank you, He Who Breaks The Sky. I will remember. Nixkamich is foreign to his world, but he has lived here long enough to call it home; I seek only to repay a debt long overdue. "</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Ben bows again, and the runes around him begin to fade, slowly breaking down into a blurry haze. As the image of the Thunderbird slowly disintegrates, Ben chants a ritual farewell:</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I live with your words in my heart and your hand on my shoulder; I am your instrument in this world. Until you call, Hurricane Eye."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As the Thunderbird leaves the plane, he sweeps up the offering with a miniature storm, in a quick second leaving not a trace.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As the ozone dissipates and the room returns to normal, Davian stands and stretches, his expression thoughtful.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"That went quite well, I think...we have a lead and I have learned a few things of interest. Of great interest."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/benjamin.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">BEN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Ben clean the floor before responding, making sure that no trace of the symbols remain. Task complete, he stands and faces Davian. "The trail is before us, yes, but our quarry is far ahead, and we will not be able to use this ritual again on this matter." The huge man neatly repacks the medicine bag and restores the carpet and furniture.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I must reflect on what was said; by the look on your face it seems we both do." Ben makes to leave, pausing on the threshold of the sliding door and turning back to Davian. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You know how to contact me. May the Great Spirit watch over us."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Ben passes through the door, there is the sound of ruffled feathers, and then a piercing cry.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian reaches into his pocket for another joint before turning to Miriam. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I normally don't chain smoke,  but after that a little calm is welcome; Even for me that was...impressive. The spiritual pressure was incredible."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I've never known a shifter. But after that..." Miriam brings her arms around herself, as if cold. "I will make sure to stay on Ben's good side."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'm afraid I don't know Straud's True Name. I've known him for a long time, but it's nothing he's ever shared with me." Her yellow eyes wander.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian takes a long drag before responding. "Indeed. It is easy for some of us (he gestures to himself and Miriam with the joint) to dismiss the Shifters as mere brutes. Ben is a reminder that they are Gaia's Chosen. And the Thunderbird...we were witness to a God, make no mistake."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sebastian rises through the floor in a puddle of blood, having invoked the ancient portal Vlad and he had made. His blade is in his hand as he steps out of the circle, eyes casting back and forth, stepping silently through the shadows. He pauses only momentarily at Vlad's Bier. He cannot help but try where all others have failed; when he too does not succeed, he sheathes his blade and starts up the stairs, ready to assume command from those two buffoons.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Some occult sense warns Davian to look over as a young, almost impossibly handsome face rises from the basement; a face very familiar to any fan of cinema. Davian's mind works quickly and he turns to Miriam for confirmation. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Sebastian Erikksson is a Vampire?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At the mention of his name, Sebastian decides to spent a blood point and cross the remaining distance in a single step, his image blurring as he appears next to Davian in a flash. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You have me at a disadvantage Sir. You know my name, but I do not know yours. Whom do I have the pleasure of meeting?" Sebastian transfers his cane and extends his hand, a look of placid geniality on his face.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Miriam stands by as the men greet each other. <i>Two firecrackers.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She had last seen Sebastian at the New Year's party, which she'd learned was an annual event for his coterie. It had been so long since she'd seen him, and here he'd created such an impressive family... He'd changed. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And yet, everything was coming together, and she feared it signaled the coming of the End.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Sebastian. It is good to see you again. This is Davian, and he is a friend to the coterie."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It is good you have come. Cedric and Mandarc have just left. They are performing a covert mission against Trelaine."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian meets Sebastian's gaze before reaching forward and taking Sebastian's iron grip. "Davian Hughes, Archmage of the Order of Hermes. What a pleasure to meet you; I had no idea you were a Friend of Vlad's."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Archmage.</i> I see. Sebastian nods as he releases his grip, maintaining eye contact. "Very Old Friends. Vlad found me a Crusader, and gave me a new cause."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian's eyes widen slightly <i>Crusader!</i> before nodding imperceptibly "A cause that I, too, have sworn to aid. We are a mongrel group...(Davian smirks impishly) you just missed the Shifter."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It is Sebastian's turn for surprise. <i>Vlad managed to earn the trust of an Archmage. But I suppose for him...</i> Recovering quickly, Sebastian continues</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Askuwheteau. We've met; an honorable man. So he is helping...good. I regret I could not come earlier, but I must maintain the Masquerade. What do we know? (Sebastian sniffs the air) Smoke? and this house rings like a bell with spiritual energy, what has happned?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian's grin fades as he relates everything he knows, including the events of today. If Sebastian was truthful in his hint, he must be Vlad's Captain. 1000 years...perhaps he could pick Sebastian's brain about a few things, once they get to know each other better...</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It is too bad," Miriam chimes in, once the men have finished relaying the news, "that Ben has left. You'll recall our dearest friend has been fostering a canine, Dexx, within these walls. But he's gone missing. If you'll recall -- Davian performed a rather impressive magical feat where he showed us the last 24h of time -- Vlad sent the dog away with a swift "shoo". But the dog hasn't returned..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I will message him shortly to confirm, but I believe he is already on watch...though perhaps I can whip something up." Davian begins to think of a ritual.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Miriam raises her gaze to look at Sebastian. "Unless you have a counter-arguement, I think it best to keep this from the Camarilla. But we should assume the news will get there eventually, through whatever avenues."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sebastian arches an eyebrow. "Why would I alert an adversary to a tactical weakness? You know me better than that, Miriam. Likewise, I won't be making any social calls unless absolutely necessary. Anything abnormal will arouse suspicion, and I am sure we are being watched as part of standard protocol. The shifter alone will start rumors, but none will connect him to what is happening. Perhaps we can even use his visits to our advantage..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was true that she'd known his ties to the Camarilla wouldn't be enough to overwhelm his loyalty to their old friend... But she'd had to say something. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Straud was supposed to make an appearance at the Blue Velvet tonight. Shall I send word to Quarq that he won't be coming? Unless we should think to send an illusion in his place."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"No. If someone pierced the illusion it would be far more damning than if Vlad just didn't show. Maybe the missing dog...he is looking personally. That might also draw out the opportunistic so we can take care of them pre-emptively."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian, content to leave the two Vampires to their scheming, gathers his focus and fixes the image of Dexx in his mind. Here boy (rolling Mind, Correspondence, Life, Time: Looking for Dexx, his life signature, or sightings of him over the last 24hrs.)</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Splotches of pale red appear in various places around the house; when you note the concentration in the dog's bed near the door, you figure out that this is a trail of the dog's Spirit. It bounces around the foyer and then out the door.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Speaking of the dog, I think I have a lead. I'll return shortly; hopefully with Dexx or some more information."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian nodes to both of them and steps out into the night.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The trail of the dog's spirit bounds all over the front of the house and you are immediately privy to some of the dog's favorite bushes and smelling-spots. It meanders around but there is a solid line trailing down the driveway, darker, and seeming more recent than the others.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You follow the trail until it leads to the cul-de-sac's statue -- a rather poor facsimile of the man himself. This statue formed a marker, a doorway into the mundane world at large. The statue seems to loom over the area, watching over his landholdings. If you venture further than this point, you will be walking through the boundary-ways that form the edge between Straud's demi-plane and Jamaica Estates.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian pauses and scrutinizes the statue while the cool night air flows around him. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wonder how you'll feel when you wake up to find the curtain pulled back... </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Shrugging his shoulders to release some tension, Davian turns away from the statue and jumps into the air, form blurring even as he leaves the ground. A large Great Horned Owl with curious feather markings soars into the air without a sound, eyes intent on the glowing trail below.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Lila, Cedric, and Mandarc scurry through a sink pipe, bound for Trelaine's spooky Cathedral of Sabbat fame...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The party is quiet for a time, focused entirely on getting their rat-bodies to navigate the thin pipe. It's a small passage and the air is thin. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>So I don't think I ever asked you, Mandarc;</i> Cedric's voice rings in his companion's minds. <i>What was the final straw that broke the camel's back when you were considering leaving Trelaine?</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila grimaces, the expression twisting her rat-visage in strange ways, before nipping Cedric on the bottom. <i>It is hard to leave your family, even if you know their crimes and have suffered through their abuse. Most vampires don't have Carlisle Cullen over there as their Sire.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Aie ~ Feisty! You're no wilting violet, are you?</i> He laughs, the small squeaks sounding weird in the mind's ear. <i>I wasn't trying to get anyone's goat necessarily, just making conversation. To tell the truth, basically everyone I know has met the guy and has reasons to hate him, except me. I'm just here because all my friends say he's a bastard.</i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric seems to allow space for Mandarc to speak, but he remains curiously quiet.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You OK over there, Mandarc? Cedric's tone shifts from jovial to gently concerned.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He pauses a moment. <i>Yeah. I'm OK. The tight space is kind of tweaking me out.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They continue to crawl through the tunnel. The heavy metal scent of the pipe seems to be decreasing in intensity, and the light level is slowly increasing. No one is saying anything, hopeful to get out of the tunnel, when Mandarc suddenly stops short and begins to cry out in pain.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Both of you turn 'round to face him, where he is resisting doubling over to fight the sensation. <i>Loud ring... Ringing. In my head. Pain!</i> But neither Cedric nor Lila can hear anything.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lila quickly pulls Mandarc back down the pipe, stopping when his 'symptoms' improve. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>So much for avoiding the wards attuned to former agents...the emanation must blanket the entire facility.  I have an idea though...</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Rat-Mandarc sighs in relief as the pain dissipates, even if momentarily.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Thank you for that. Wow. I'm not sure I've ever felt such pain.</i> Mandarc seems drawn into himself, shocked from the telepathic intrusion. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>What did it sound like?</i> Cedric asks. <i>It was a ringing? Unnatural? How could they insert a mechanical sound into telepathic pathways?</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/sune.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILA//</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc is finally able to relax his face, and though he is not able to see you, in his round black eyes, you are able to see what you think is gratitude. It is strange not being able to reach out to him and make sure he's alright, but you will have to make do.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Nice work.</i> Cedric transmits as he leads the way through the tube. You catch up to where you were, look backwards, and continue through the pipe when you see that nothing is amiss.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The pipe makes a sharp turn upward and you're climbing upwards toward a dim source of light. <i>Finally.</i> There is a small metal grate covering the opening, but Cedric pushes against it and it quickly pops out of place, clamoring against a spherical metal sink basin. The three of you climb out of the opening to catch your breath and fully open your lungs. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The basin is small and shallow, the kind of sink that you'd find it difficult to use if you were possessed of your ordinary shape. It struggles to hold three full-grown rats, so you peek your head out over the edge to observe the room you find yourself in. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's a cavernous wine cellar with only a singular candle, at the far end, and between you and that candle are four rows of large wine barrels.

This cat is indeed real, and something about it seems to weakly sparkle with magic. The cat is not magical, but someone with access to magic indeed loves this cat. Its fur is practically pristine, unexpected for a cat in a dusty basement wine cellar. Magical energy just barely caresses its being, like static electricity on a cold winter's day, clinging to the end of each unit of fur.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Lila stares at the edge of the sink and gathers her will. With a small pop a small grey mouse appears on the edge and falls to the ground, making a beeline for the door. Lila programs a few instincts into the poor meatbag: 1) flee out of the room 2) zig-zag when running, and 3) squeak when pursued.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The spell goes off without fail. The mouse skitters effortlessly across the floor, directly into the viewing frame of the orange cat. There is a heavy pause in the room before a sudden whoosh of fur and claw bounds toward the mouse. The mouse, however, is agile and with its quick reflexes, runs out of reach of the cat's dangerous paws. The mouse titters in panic, changes direction, and leads the cat out of the room.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Give the cat what it wants.</i> Cedric comments in approval. He turns to face Mandarc and the two nod in understanding. They jump from the sink and plop on the fieldstone floor. They are bounding toward the hallway where Lila lays in wait.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The wine cellar's entrance has a door, but it's been pushed open and by the dust on the floor, hasn't been closed in quite some time. There are a few smaller doors on this floor but they've all been shut. The candle's dim light illuminates a stone staircase set to one side of the room. A draft flows slowly from the opening in the ceiling; the slow airflow indicates to you that you are not on the only basement level, rather, the floor above you is likely below ground level as well. There is a Christmas tree, desiccated, shoved into a corner of the dusty room.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">You choose the door adjacent to the wine cellar. The knob jiggles a little bit in its housing; if it had been possible to lock the door it no longer is possible.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Inside the room is a very faint magical aura but it seems to come from nothing openly displayed; it seems to have dissipated from what appear to be antique chests. The objects are ornately decorated in the fashion of traditional magical objects, but they appear to not have been used in quite some time.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As you step in, Cedric and Mandarc follow, seeming a little awkward in their human forms. Cedric picks up a chest and removes the lock, opening the lid.

<p class="ppl-sez">Progressively the plaque shows signs of cracking and then completely shatters apart, its remains turning to dust on the floor below. The chamber is now open to you and no more wards appear to exist.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">This is Trelaine's personal office, complete with a small seating area before a small office with desk. The wall shelves have a number of bric-a-brac on them.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The room is curiously sparse, though you're not sure what you were expecting. There are hardly any personal effects, there are no books, no clothes. As you walk toward the wall shelves near the desk, it appears this is the only place he's stored any items.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There are three jars labeled Subject #0736, Subject #124, and Subject #6439. They radiate magic, albeit weakly. There are two cubes of crystal, worn so smooth as to be impossibly soft and almost, but not quite, opaque.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc shrugs emphatically. For the first time since the pipe, he speaks, thinking himself in the quiet of the office. He speaks quietly, looking around himself anxiously.

<p class="ppl-sez">Soon you find yourself on the second floor of what you presume is the "annex". The building is in magnificent condition, with ornate wood carvings around the edges of the walls. The paint is in impeccable condition. All together the building has no 'lived in feel', you suppose, simply, because the only things living here are the undead. But the building is unexpectedly large and sprawling, each hallway seems to go on endlessly in either direction. Here in front of you are confessional rooms, a row of them. </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Just as they turn to leave, Lila sends out a barrage of invisible magical 'eyes' that are programmed to swarm down each hallway, branching off so that they map the entire facility and record the image of current appearance.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The eyes will continue to transmit their data as they walk, so Lila strides off towards the sanctuary.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">The trio backtrack through the stairs until they end up back at the side entrance to the dais. It is hard to get a direct vision, but through your aura-sight, you sense Trelaine, looking over the congregation like a specter, and four other evil vampiric auras on stage. Their auras are tinged with black veins, indicating diablerists. The victim's aura is being suppressed and she almost appears mortal, making her the fifth figure on stage.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Trelaine continues to preach and at predictable intervals, the crowd cries back in agreement. </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Lila gathers her will and forms the spell in her mind: a large flock of seagulls blow off course and straight into the cathedral window...She makes sure to program a copious amount of honks, flapping, and droppings, before they manage to 'find'  the exit.

<p class="ppl-sez">In a flash, Cedric zips past you and into the kerfuffle, where glass is fluttering down from the ceiling. It's quite cinematic, really, the chaos that such a simple gesture has invoked. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric is at home rushing around the battlefield and quickly places his hands upon the stake and prepares to pull it out. One of the figures cries out, "No! She's mine!!" She lunges for Cedric and you see that she's also an adept of Celerity.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Aine, you find yourself grappling on the floor with the vampiress who was about to be on the receiving end of this putrid show of diablerie. As you get her to the ground, you are able to see that though she is supercharged with the souls of dead vampires, she is still your inferior. You have her grappled.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric succeeds in removing the stake from the immobilized vampiress and turns around to see what Aine has done on his behalf. "Aine? Is that you?" It's been years since they've seen each other and here he was, helping him. And as he stood there, sensing his moment of Celerity soon to end, he realized the vampiress being grappled was none other than Vanessa Tang, a recent convert of Trelaine's. One that had come from a family of magic-users. It was a face he'd been warned about by Vlad.</p>

She convulses and then retches pure shadow on Aine and you recognize the power as The Darkness Within. The inky shadow pours over Áine's form, seeping into her clothes and clinging to her person. Make a Stamina roll diff 6 to resist losing 1 blood per turn. (V20 p191)</p>
