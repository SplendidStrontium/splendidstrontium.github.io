<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Soon you're crawling around the side streets of Jamaica Estates where the houses seem to go on for miles, but you traverse them quickly without traffic.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Soon, the Straud Mansion looms over you from the hill. Cedric takes a right and stops in front of a modest brick townhome. "Here we are, Widowshild, been in the Straud family for generations. Haha." Mandarc attempts to crack a wry joke, but it's generally unsuccessful.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I'll go in and get him. He's been staying here since the Master abducted him from Trente Gagarin's estate last year. He's a bit of a sensitive soul. Be right back, kiddos." Mandarc disappears in a burst of vampiric speed.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion "So this is Straud's neighborhood...peaceful. I assume that's his house in the back?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"He's been here since before anyone can remember. Rumor is he set up shop in these parts before the Revolution." Cedric says. "Yeah that's his place up there on the hill. Suitably spooky, right?"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Although I find Widowshild even creepier, personally. Mandarc lived here for a time with Friday Perkins, you remember her, right? Had a curse about televisions, if you ever experienced that. She had a tendency to just fry TVs whenever she got near. I think she learned to control it as she got older. Left the Magicademy and traveled around a bit. Wound up back here with Mandarc. But it didn't end so well. She's no longer part of our coterie."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Actually, she's shacked up with your Sire's grandson, Aine. It's another situation we should probably step into and twist the hand of fate."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"So Friday dated Mandarc? Most interesting. So this all happened recently." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"My Sire's what? Bronald the Lesser? She's dating him?!"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yep. I personally think she was trying to get turned into a vampire, some spider worshipper or some shit like that, and when she finally realized Vlad and Mandarc weren't going to play ball, she jumped ship. She ran off with -- and that's great -- Bronald the Lesser in late 2020." Cedric seems to be enjoying the gossip.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"They are leading what seems to be a perfectly dull suburban lifestyle. Bronald is of middling at best magical talent and seems to have little interest in improving himself. What a joke."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Soon, Mandarc emerges from the house with an awkward young man who must be Emmitt Skinner. He has large eyes and, behind a magical illusion, blue skin. He follows Mandarc, who gets in the second car.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric shifts the car into first and turns out into the roadway again, bound for Straud Mansion up on the hill. He takes this moment to deliver some exposition.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Things you should know about Emmitt: half-human half-alien son of Joaquin and Cassie Skinner. Joaquin passed away. Trente Gagarin stole Emmitt from his mother. We stole him back."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It was previously uncertain to me whether the two were from the same planet but this information from the Thunderbird seems to imply that they are. But there is something very different between the two beyond just age. Evolution, maybe, or something else."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In front of the Straud Mansion is a large oval carpark. Each car takes its own side. Everyone gets out of the car and prepares to enter the grey-bricked mansion.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Under different circumstances, this would be the highlight of my week." Gwydion takes in the cool darkness that surrounds the house "Las Sombres Tenebrosas" he whispers to himself.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Áine's senses allow her to hear the comment and she snorts. "Of course you're a fan, look at how you dress."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc walks up the steps with Emmitt closely in tow. It seems the young boy lacks a certain confidence despite his size.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc removes a key from his pocket and looks back at the small crowd while he undoes the lock. "The Master has both mundane and enchanted locks on his doors."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric, standing back with the rest of the crew, laughs internally at Gwydion and Áine's banter. "A breach of the Masquerade and beyond, that one. I like mostly how it captured the witch."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The door swings open, revealing a rich red carpet and a dramatic, high-ceiling foyer. There is a large bookshelf and matching end-tables. A slight wind seems to blow from the door but you're certain you're imagining things.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Welcome to Straud Mansion. Capes are welcome attire here." Cedric flashes a slight smile.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Taking a look around, Gwydion is impressed with the genteel opulence of the mansion. "You weren't kidding. This is magnificent...all of these look to be originals. Of course they are."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Okay, so. Emmitt, Quarq, I think each of you has received the current situation on your way over here. Count Straud slumbers in the basement so we'll make our way down there. This way!" Cedric motions the party to follow him.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In the next room are Sebastian and Miriam. Cedric moves over to display his ragged group of heroes to the two. "We've managed to track down some people we think can help."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/emmittskinner.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">EMMITT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But Emmitt protests. "I'm not sure I can use telepathy in this... Tellurian Basic Neural Impulse or whatever."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/quark-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">QUARQ//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Ehh, you just have to know you can do it. It comes naturally if you're born into it. Trust me." Quarq counters.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Gwydion, this is Sebastian Eriksson and Miriam Duatba." Cedric introduces the newcomers to the old guard.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion extends a long-fingered hand to both Miriam and Sebastian. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Honored to make your acquaintance; Gwydion Yanúla. I'm an old school associate of Cedric's and member of the Society of Ether."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/miriam.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MIRIAM//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Miriam exchanges pleasantries with Gwydion. "It's very nice to meet you, Gwydion. Any friend of Cedric's is a friend of mine." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Noting that Gwydion seemed unimpressed with Sebastian's fame, Cedric seems satisfied and continues talking.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"We'll all go downstairs, that's where Vlad is. Gwydion, can you summon some candles and holders for us?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion nods and snaps his fingers. 6 globes of white light balanced on the tips of smooth metal cylinders appear floating in front of the members of the group.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Thank you, Gwydion." The candles hover in front of the group. "The doorway into the basement is over here." Cedric leads the party through the living room and to the stairwell to the lower level.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Let's hope this all goes well."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It appears he laid himself to rest here in the crypt. As you can see, his aura is here but it's weak. We'll set up here."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The crowd slowly shuffles in to the crypt. It is cold and dark, except for the enchanted candles. "I say that this shouldn't be a closed casket affair. I'll take responsibility if it's the wrong decision."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/pidge.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">PIDGE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He walks over and pulls the top off the casket. Inside is the silver-haired gentleman with whom everyone is acquainted. He lies perfectly still, seemingly unaware of their presence. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Everyone stares at him for a moment. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Preserving the reverent silence, Mandarc goes first. "Quarq spoke his true name on the way over, I think Emmitt is just a little nervous. But you're almost ready, aren't you?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/emmittskinner.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">EMMITT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yeah, I...just...Straud adopted me only a little time ago and I barely know him. He seems like a nice enough man..." Emmitt meanders a little, trying to gather courage.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yeah, Quarq showed me his true name, even wrote it down for me and gave it to me as a memory. But it's strange. It's not really a word so much as it's a very specific feeling. I guess a neural impulse that's mathematically precise. It's weird. I'll give it a try."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Áine finds herself suddenly emotional about the Old Man. <i>I hope this works...I never realized how much it meant to have this place waiting...</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion looks  on with fascination, careful not to make any movement that would break the spell of the moment. <i>Very Interesting Indeed...natural telepaths...</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vlad-enr.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The smell of pitch invades the room and a dark cloud rushes toward the center of the room. Rising from the coffin, shocked, is Vlad, with tall elfin ear and blazing blue flames where his eyes should be. There is a flash of rage sent out like a shockwave into each of their minds but it quickly subsides as he comprehends, revealing a sort of illusory emotion. Eye to eye, he's seen each of them, and realized why they have come. His 'dark form' fades, silver hair covers his dome, his ears once again round, and a look of understanding rises in his face. </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"If you may judge a man by his friendships, then I am quite wealthy indeed. I apologize about the outburst. I was somewhere else and I was summoned by primeval means. My rage was not directed at you. Thank you for waking me."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He blinks to a new posture, fully out of the casket. "Gwydion, Áine, it is good to see you both again. I wish I could be welcoming you into my home under better circumstances."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Emmitt." He turns to the young man. "Thank you especially. It was very brave of you to do something you weren't sure you could do."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to make my way back upstairs and greet you all properly. I've had enough sleeping to last a lifetime."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion bows low from the waist "Honor to see you again, Count. I have been privileged to be part of this gathering and will hold this moment <i>closely.</i>"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Perhaps you'll help me plan an action of retribution in time." But he stops and rethinks. "No, perhaps not. I do not know. I know that only Trente Gagarin could cast such a spell of despair upon me. I do not plan on letting such a transgression go unpunished but I do not want anyone to get caught in the crossfire. She keeps children in her house."</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He pauses, the gravity of the situation speaking for itself. "On to other things, Áine, Gwydion, how did you two come to this place? Were my assistants in need of your services? I was unaware you were acquainted."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Áine looks over at Gwydion quickly before answering. "We hadn't met until this evening; I was on assignment, rescuing Hua Jia from Trelaine, when who should burst out the hallway but Cedric,  accompanied by Mandarc and a mage named Lila. I assisted in Hua Jia's rescue and was  celebrating with Cedric, Mandarc, and Gwydion, whom Cedric had recognized at the BV, when news came from another mage, 'Magister Davian', with the knowledge of how to wake you up. From there it was a straight line to Quarq and then Emmitt, with all of us along for the ride."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes, Magister Davian and his companion, Ben, are the true architects of this plan; I was chosen as his representative and proxy as Lila is busy analyzing the results of the raid on Trelaine's Cathedral. I will notify him immediately that you are awake."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The Count takes a moment to take in the litany he's been given, all while keeping a plain face. "You say there was a raid on my rival's Brooklyn headquarters?" He lifts an eyebrow. "And I take it everyone made it out okay? Including this..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/jiahua.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">JIA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">As they round the stairs there is a Chinese vampiress who seems more beautiful than ever. She's combed her hair and her red qipao dress seems to shine in the light.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Jia, from the Hua family." She bows and holds out her hand for Straud, understanding his importance.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Yes, I see. I have not been to the Middle Kingdom in many years. I wonder if there are still those there loyal to the old message."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/jiahua.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">JIA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I had not participated in courtly politics for many a year. I was occupying myself with poetry and painting." Jia humbly comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"As a distant statesman once said, just because you are not interested in politics..."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/jiahua.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">JIA//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"I am aware of the old adages but... Perhaps it is a tale for another time."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Perhaps." Straud says politely. He turns back to his coterie and changes the topic.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"You say this raid was led by a mage named Lila? Where is she then?"</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Lila took the items we acquired from Trelaine's 'office' and took them back to Davian's Townhouse for analysis. We recovered a notebook, two crystal spheres, and 3 remains samples." </p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Davian's young apprentice wastes little time, as is also true of the rest of you." Straud's living room is rather filled to the brim with bodies. "I am impressed by the speed with which you all have awoken me but I need to tidy up some loose ends." He holds a finger to his temple. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>Davian. I have awoken. The coterie is with me. What I need to do is just becoming clear. Thank you for your assistance, dear friend. I needed your wisdom.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian's response is saturated with joy and relief at hearing Straud's mental voice. <i>Good to hear from you, we were all getting a bit worried. I am honored to have been of service. I am currently looking for Dexx, but now that you are awake perhaps I will return and assist in dispatching your guests...(knowing amusement filters through the link).</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>The mutt has gone missing? That is something that our young friends neglected to mention. I am sure the dog has gone trailing a scent. I will deal with that myself, the little scamp. Yes, come back to my home; I certainly was not expecting such...a crowd. It is something that will stay with me for quite some time.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/davian.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">At Straud's assent, a small portal appears in the air in front of Davian, invisible to any but those with Supernatural awareness. <i>I come. I will bring Lila, she should be there to take the credit for her initiative. I am glad you had a crowd; if I'm honest I just wish I had been there as well. See you soon.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-portrait.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud, finishing his conversation with Davian, refocuses his attention upon the crowd in his house. It almost felt like one of his New Year's parties, with such vigor. He steps out on the front stoop to stand beneath the clear night sky. <i>It is good to stand beneath your calm, knowing light. </i></p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He spoke of the Eigen, spirits who slept as stars, glowing everbright in the inky vacuum of space. He would need their help in the coming days.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But for now he needed guidance on what to do about Trente Gagarin. If she had her way, he'd be worse than sleeping in a dream, he'd be...dead. But he could not let fantasies of revenge take his better judgement from him. But that being said...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He could not act as if she were not a threat. If she could do this to him, what other tricks had she learnt since leaving the homeworld? </p>
<p class="ppl-sez"><i>She should not have crossed me.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/seb-sheriff.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">SEBASTIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Sebastian watches the crowd, relieved that Vlad is conscious and seemingly no worse for wear. <i>Now that he is back, it is time to punish those responsible. We cannot let them commit these sort of actions without consequences...Trelaine should have known of Trente's plan, and will perceive our strike as retribution. When Straud appears at the BV tomorrow, we will ensure Trelaine knows; then he will see that he suffers for nothing. After he understands, we hit Trente.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/ainebaird.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">ÁINE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Áine also watches the room, but mostly so she doesn't look at Gwydion. <i>We've shown him many secrets tonight...yet another Mage, and this one strange even for those eccentric beings. His aura...Áine had never seen anything like it before: an inferno of green fire and golden lightning that writhed as if alive, yet Straud didn't seem that discomfited to see him...</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/gwydion1.png" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">GWYDION//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Gwydion uses his innate Forces abilities to watch Áine while making smalltalk with Miriam. <i>A curious evening. It had been a long time since he had had such fun. The adventure...but also the girl. Áine...an Angel of Death. Even his Avatar seems fascinated. That should worry me. Should.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/mandarc3.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Mandarc approaches Miriam, intent on getting back the contents of his pockets. "Seems silly, but if I'd have been captured, there were some things here I really wouldn't want to lose." </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And here, they approached the high midnight hour. The night was still young and tonight he'd participated in a strike against Trelaine and made it out alive. But being in that place had strengthened his convictions. Trelaine was no longer his master and never again would be.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-bluecoat.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Kevin looks over the party and sees that Straud has left to get some night air. We should probably clear out too. </p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"Emmitt, let me walk you back to Widowshild. You looked like you were about to get into bed."</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Cedric sees Kevin leave and realizes that Vlad has left the house. The others are making small talk and making the whole house vibrate with energy.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But he knows there are still tasks left unfinished.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He exits the house through the front door. Vlad sits on the first stair. There is a silence for a moment as they comprehend each other.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">"It's good to have you back, sir." Cedric says, with as much confidence as he can muster.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">DAVIAN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud's last syllable hangs in the air for a moment before a portal bursts into being on the pavement right in front of the stairs. Davian and Lila step out, the latter holding a curious satchel that is completely sealed.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian pulls a dusty bottle of wine out of his coat pocket. "Good evening gentlemen. I thought I might bring something to celebrate." (those with enhanced senses might be able to discern the label, 'Dom Perignon 1921'.) Waving his hand over the bottle it frosts over then pops, just as four crystal goblets appear.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Davian pours the flaxen vintage into the glasses then hands one to each member of the small group. "To interdisciplinary collaboration!"</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">After all have drained their goblets, Davian refills them and calls for a second toast. "To my impetuous Apprentice, who's brought you a kingly Rising gift." (At this Lila blushes and holds out the bag to Straud). "To Lila Black, who has helped bring the dawn." </p>

<p class="ppl-sez">"You are always perfectly prepared for celebration. Davian, your fine taste is appreciated. Thank you. It is good to be back." He takes the gift from Lila, who he recognizes immediately with her bright red hair and green eyes. Her aura was sparkling particularly bright right now. "And thank you, Lila, for taking part in what I hope will be the first step of a cleansing of this world. A great many evils have been allowed to flourish but no more. You are a bold mage and I know we will see much from you. I will be watching your progress carefully." Straud tucks the gift away inside the folds of his coat. "You have quite the mentor. I think the two of you will accomplish great things together."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Lila blushes more deeply, but her reply is steady. "Thank you Count;   Magister Davian has a... reputation, but after his instruction of the last few months and the events of last evening, I consider myself extremely fortunate to be his Apprentice." Her embarrassment increasing, she quickly changes the subject. "The satchel contains Trelaine's notebook, three mage remains, and two crystal orbs, each with a nano machine/AI embedded in the center. I would be excited to continue to work on these, but it seemed only proper for you to have them."</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">Davian nods his head. "A mercy that many would not extend." Davian drains his glass throws it and the empty bottle over his shoulder; they disappear before they hid the pavement. Reaching into his coat pocket, he removes a joint from his cigarette case, lights, and takes a deep puff then hands it over to Lila. "So, if I know you there is more in-store for Ms. Gagarin. Can we help or is there something else you would have us do? At the very least, I think I will make an appearance at the BV tomorrow night to catch up with my good friend  Vlad." Davian winks.</p>

In his wake, appears a cyan line segment hanging in mid air. He steps forward, reaches both hands into the cut, and pulls it open. The silver-haired man enters the portal and holds out his hand to his friend. "Watch your step..."</p>
