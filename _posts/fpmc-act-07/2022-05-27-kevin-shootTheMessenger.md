<p class="ppl-sez">Unfortunately, yes. He had always worked himself to the bone.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Times were different then. Nowadays, you have an ill, there's this and that doctor to help you. But it was not like that then. My father probably hid the details of his sickness for many years before he finally succumbed.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">He was not like fathers today who dote on their children and try to give them every need.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He was distant not in a personal way but defensively, in the manner of all adult men who felt obligated to hide their true selves from others. He was not any different than others of his generation and I do not fault him for it...</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">but make no mistake -- he did not interrupt his evenings to read to me each night as your father did -- He provided for me in innumerable other ways -- sent me to nice schools and always made sure my shirts were starched -- He was not loving nor was he imaginative.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Unless, of course, he kept a dear secret realm from me. He was entirely Ordinary and I did not expect acceptance of my supernatural beliefs from him.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">It certainly limited my early progress.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But when I first laid eyes upon your father, I lost a bit of myself.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I had not been without friendships but all of them seemed child's play when I overheard him speaking to my father. It was raining outside, in that soothing, cleansing way of summer rain. And when we first laid eyes on each other, I wondered if he, too, were magical, for his gaze seemed to peer into my soul and expose me for the phony I was.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In that moment, I was instantly and irrevocably smitten.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">I was lucky enough that your father felt the same way about me.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Times were different then. My father quickly gleaned that this business deal had potential to be just the first point of interest.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I suppose, too, his impending mortality weighed heavily upon his mind.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">It did not bother me precisely because it was what I wanted to happen.</p>
