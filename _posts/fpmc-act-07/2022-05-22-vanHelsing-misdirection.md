#### VAN HELSING

> YOU TOLD ME BEFORE THAT YOU GREW UP IN A GROUP HOME.

#### LARRY

> THAT WAS AFTER THE ORPHANAGE.

#### VAN HELSING

> RIGHT. YOU WERE ADOPTED.

#### LARRY

> I WOULDN'T USE THE WORD ADOPTED. 
> 
> SCOUTED, RECRUITED. SOMETHING MORE LIKE THAT.

#### VAN HELSING

> YOU FELT FACELESS AMONG THE FELLOW CHILDREN?
> 
> AS IF YOU WEREN'T CHOSEN FOR YOUR TALENTS AND PERSONALITY.

#### LARRY

> OH, I WAS CHOSEN FOR MY TALENTS FOR SURE.

#### VAN HELSING

> ARE YOU ANGRY AT MYRTLE?

#### LARRY

> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
> 
> JUST CONFUSED.
> 
> I WISH SHE WEREN'T DEAD.

#### VAN HELSING

> IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT PEOPLE DIE.
> 
> ESPECIALLY THE FEW PEOPLE CLOSE TO US.

#### LARRY

> I JUST WISH I'D BEEN THERE FOR HER.

#### VAN HELSING

> WE'LL NEVER BE SATISFIED WITH OUR GOODBYES, EVEN IF WE GET THEM.

#### LARRY

> I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.
> 
> THE HEADMISTRESS HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME.

#### VAN HELSING

> WHAT DID SHE DO FOR YOU?

#### LARRY

> SHE GAVE ME A HOME WHEN I HAD NONE.
> 
> A FAMILY.
> 
> GOT ME OFF THE MEDICATION AND TOLD ME I WAS NORMAL.

#### VAN HELSING

> THAT'S WONDERFUL.

#### LARRY

> I HATE HER SON THOUGH.

#### VAN HELSING

> WE DON'T ALWAYS LIKE PEOPLE WE COME IN CONTACT WITH, FAMILY OR NOT.

#### LARRY

> I CAN'T EVEN PLACE WHY I DON'T LIKE HIM, BUT I DON'T.
> 
> I DON'T THINK IT'S JEALOUSY BECAUSE MYRTLE'S FAVORITE WAS CLEARLY TZU.

#### VAN HELSING

> OH?

#### LARRY

> TZU WAS ANOTHER OF THE CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL.
> 
> SHE'S A FAIR BIT YOUNGER THAN ME, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.
> 
> NO, I DON'T EVEN THINK KEVIN WAS HER FAVORITE. 
> 
> I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD THING SINCE THERE WERE SO MANY OF US.

#### VAN HELSING

> A GOOD TEACHER IS IMPARTIAL.

#### LARRY

> I THINK THE HEADMISTRESS WAS AS IMPARTIAL AS SHE COULD BE.
> 
> IT WASN'T THAT.
> 
> KEVIN JUST STAYED IN HIS ROOM BASICALLY ALL THE TIME.
> 
> MAYBE THAT'S IT, THAT HE NEVER HAD TO TALK TO THE REST OF US.

#### VAN HELSING

> DID YOU EVER FIND THE SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS TO BE OVERWHELMING?

#### LARRY

> A LITTLE BIT.
> 
> I MEAN, I GOT MY TIME ALONE BUT I ALWAYS SHARED A ROOM.

#### VAN HELSING

> DID YOU WANT YOUR OWN ROOM?

#### LARRY

> WHO DOESN'T?
> 
> AND I SUPPOSE, TOO, THAT THE INSIDE OF HIS ROOM WAS FORBIDDEN TO ME.
> 
> THAT ALWAYS GOT ME.
> 
> OF COURSE, IT WASN'T THE ONLY PART OF THE HOUSE I WASN'T ALLOWED TO GO.
> 
> THE GIRLS' ROOM...
> 
> THE BASEMENT.

#### VAN HELSING

> IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD, FEELING LIKE NOTHING WAS TRULY YOURS.

#### LARRY

> I GOT USED TO IT.

#### VAN HELSING

> DO YOU FEEL LIKE ANYTHING TODAY IS YOURS?

#### LARRY

> MY CAR. 
> 
> SHE'S BEEN WITH ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN.

#### VAN HELSING

> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CAR.

#### LARRY

> STICK. VANITY PLATE.
> 
> DARK BLUE PAINT THAT LOOKS FLECKED WITH GLITTER.

#### VAN HELSING

> HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DRIVE?

#### LARRY

> I TOOK CLASSES.
> 
> THE SCHOOL PAID FOR IT.

#### VAN HELSING

> DO YOU LIKE DRIVING?

#### LARRY

> HELL YEAH, I LOVE DRIVING. 
> 
> I FEEL CAPABLE BEHIND THE WHEEL.
> 
> NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.
> 
> I'VE BUMPED A BUMPER A FEW TIMES BUT NOTHING MORE MAJOR THAN THAT.

#### VAN HELSING

> NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT?
> 
> THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF.

#### LARRY

> I AM PROUD.
> 
> BUT MAYBE I'M JUST LUCKY.

<BR><I>And then he mumbles, under his breath.</i>

#### LARRY

> FIGURES I'D BE LUCKY IN SOME INCONSEQUENTIAL FIELD.

#### VAN HELSING

> TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR HEADMISTRESS.
> 
> HOW DID YOU FIND OUT SHE'D PASSED?

#### LARRY

> OH, THAT PISSED ME OFF TOO.
> 
> KEVIN WAS HARDLY MOVED AT ALL BY HER DEATH.
> 
> NO TEARS, NO NOTHING.

#### VAN HELSING

> IT CAN BE HARD WHEN WE DON'T SEE THE EMOTIONS WE FEEL.

#### LARRY

> I GUESS PART OF ME WAS EXPECTING, OR AT THE VERY LEAST, HOPING, TO BE MENTIONED IN HER WILL.
> 
> I WAS WANTING TO FEEL THAT I WAS A PART OF SOMETHING.

#### VAN HELSING

> LIKE YOU WERE HER SON?

#### LARRY

> WELL, PART OF ME IS!
> 
> SHE'S MORE MY MOTHER THAN ANYONE ELSE.
> 
> KEVIN'S BLASÃ‰ ATTITUDE REMINDED ME THAT I AM NOTHING.
> 
> I WORKED SO HARD TO BE RECOGNIZED BY HER. BUT NOW SHE'S GONE --
> 
> AND HE WILL NEVER BE MY BROTHER.
