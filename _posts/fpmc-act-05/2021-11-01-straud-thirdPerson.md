<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Straud.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think I saw Firsthome.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Only I was calling it Coreworld.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric-tb-focus.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Lots of characters.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But the first thing I think is important are the spinning computers.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The world was composed of a white core, focused especially on the auditory beauty of music.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The outside used black computers and it was dominated by pure computation.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In a joking way, it almost reminded me of the Mac/PC rivalry that was a meme before memes in the early twenti-first century.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The white core was almost totally unaware of the demonic overlords, and kept as a pet to, and inside the dark world.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Characters, characters.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There was a small boy, very young. He ran around the core world, the edge of grey. trying to deliver a message.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He was in an Oriental restaurant.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There was a poisonous bug, a venomous stinkbug, who was trying to assassinate him. I'm not sure it was going after him in particular, but anyone with a pure heart and aim to underdo the parentage.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He made it though, as far as I saw. He was going from the front of the restaurant to the back --</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Come to think of it, the food might have been an illusion too, because I smelled nothing, saw nothing, and I felt I had true sight here in this vision.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric-tb-focus.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There was Sailor Moon, too, a sad blonde-haired girl.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She was estranged from her friends, the Planettes.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They, at least the contingent that remained, were locked in an eternal attempt at escape, and were skipping, bounding, leaping around the planet, trying to outrun their pursuers.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Tuxedo Kamen was somewhere else, in the mirror kingdom of sand.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The mirror kingdom of sand had many grocery stores, and existed on the edge of the white and dark Cores.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think I saw the Islander.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was trying to get to him via plane, I needed to get to him as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was viewing the itineraries of the planes, their planned paths, and it was going over the planet in the North. Earth.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I needed to get, or stay, North. In the cold.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I had a vision. I saw him in his room, laying ill, laying sick.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't think I made it to him.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vlad-ugh.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">There was a clear and simple reason I converted him.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I saw him in the nightmare.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't think I made it to him.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I just couldn't get there in time.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He needed more help than I could provide.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vlad-ugh.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He returned home to Sulani.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">In part because of your prodding to help his family.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">I... </p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vlad-ugh.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It was the right decision.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He wasn't meant for this land.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You couldn't get there in time because of the time limitation.</p>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And Sailor Moon, she was able to push herself, using wind?</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wasn't sure if she could fly or not.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The Coreworld -- it was sort of like a "Hunger Games" thing.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">The two cores didn't understand the other at all but there was a certain direction of exploitation.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And that stinkbug was extremely frightening.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I saw it kill two small people, other messengers, although I got the feeling, not that they deserved it, but they didn't have the same strength of character as the one who survived.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I hate to think that way.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But I was so glad that the young boy survived.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He kept making his DEX checks.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I saw so much, it was disorienting.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I am sure I am missing something, but I came as soon as I had the vision.</p>
