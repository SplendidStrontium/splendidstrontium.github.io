<br><i>There is a small house in Stormwind City that shelters a Night Elf. She is known to be a bit of a "lunatic" by her detractors but she continues on, her faith carrying her through the doubt.</i>

<i>Last week she thought she saw something in the mirror.</i>

#### ERIOLANNA

> AND I THOUGHT I SAW IT WITH MY BAD EYE.

#### PIPPSEE

> IMPROBABLE.
> 
> YOUR EYE WAS DAMAGED YEARS AGO.
> 
> BUT THAT BEING SAID, IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF -- THE BLIND GAINING THE POWER OF PROPHECY.

#### ERIOLANNA

> JUST WHAT I NEED, TO SEE THINGS I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF UNDERSTANDING.

#### PIPPSEE

> OH, DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
> 
> I AM SURE THAT IF YOU IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE VISION, YOU'LL FIND MORE TRUTH THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

<BR><I>The gnome was ever the optimist.</i>

#### ERIOLANNA

> ALL I SAW WAS A...AN IMPRESSION.
> 
> A HAZE.
> 
> BUT I WAS SURE I SAW IT FROM THE LEFT.

#### PIPPSEE

> PERHAPS THE MIRROR IS ENCHANTED.

#### ERIOLANNA

> I DID NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE SO BUT NOTHING CAN BE DISCOUNTED.

<BR><I>Eriolanna blinks, considering her claim.</i>

#### ERIOLANNA

> UNLESS IT'S ME.
> 
> PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CHECK THE MIRROR.

#### PIPPSEE

> MY LADY. I TRUST YOUR ABILITY TO DETECT MAGIC.

#### ERIOLANNA

> I GUESS.
> 
> IF YOU THINK --

#### PIPPSEE

> THAT IS, OF COURSE, ASSUMING YOUR USUAL FASTIDIOUS ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
> 
> BUT EVEN THE MOST PREDICTABLE AMONG US CAN BE DISTRACTED INTO MOMENTARY LAPSES OF PATTERN.
> 
> PERHAPS BY A STRAY THOUGHT OR POIGNANT RECOLLECTION.
> 
> WERE YOU INDULGING IN THAT DANGEROUS PASTTIME AGAIN?

#### ERIOLANNA

> I DON'T THINK SO.
> 
> NOT THIS TIME.

#### PIPPSEE

> PERHAPS I SHOULD --

#### ERIOLANNA

> WOULD YOU? INSPECT IT FOR ME?
> 
> ...IF THAT IS INDEED WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.
> 
> I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING.

#### PIPPSEE

> NO PROBLEM, MY LADY.
> 
> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE THE THING A ONCE OVER.
> 
> OR EVEN TWICE, AS THE CASE MAY BE.

<BR><I>But the inquiry proves fruitless. The gnome passes it over several times, examining the reflective and non-reflective sides of the object.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> WHERE DID YOU ACQUIRE THE MIRROR?

#### ERIOLANNA

> A SHOP IN OLD TOWN. 
> 
> THEY SELL ALL SORTS OF HOUSEWARES.

<BR><I>She continues to inspect the mirror.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> IT APPEARS NORMAL ENOUGH.
> 
> BUT IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR CURSED OBJECTS TO APPEAR BESIDE THE ORDINARY IN PLACES OF SALE.
> 
> NO, IT APPEARS COMPLETELY UNMAGICAL, EXCEPTING THE FACT THAT IT'S BACKED WITH SILVER.
> 
> SILVER, OF COURSE, PROVIDES SOME PROTECTION AGAINST ENCHANTMENTS.
> 
> OTHER METALS MAY TAKE UP MODIFICATION A BIT EASIER.

<BR><I>Pippsee arranges the glass so that she and her companion can both see themselves in its reflection.

#### PIPPSEE

> CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT YOU SAW?

#### ERIOLANNA

> IT WAS ME, BUT SLIGHTLY OFF-TONE. 
> 
> MY HAIR WAS DARKER, MY FACIAL STRUCTURE SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT.
> 
> I SAW MY PUPILS IN PLAIN SIGHT.

#### PIPPSEE

> YOU ELVES DO HAVE DISTINCTIVE EYES.
> 
> I'D BE ALARMED, TOO, IF I SAW MYSELF WITHOUT MY MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURE.

#### ERIOLANNA

> IT...IT WASN'T PRECISELY MY FACE THOUGH.

#### PIPPSEE

> REMINDS ME OF A DREAM I HAD ONCE. 
> 
> I HAD BRIGHT YELLOW HAIR.
> 
> FRIGHTENING -- NO, UNNERVING -- IT WAS.
> 
> BUT THAT WAS A DREAM.
> 
> A WAKING DREAM, BUT A DREAM NONETHELESS.

#### ERIOLANNA

> THIS WAS NO DREAM.
> 
> I WAS SURE OF WHAT I SAW.
> 
> LIKE...A STRANGER'S FACE -- NO -- NOT A STRANGER.
> 
> A SISTER.
> 
> A SISTER I'VE NEVER BEFORE MET BUT SOMEONE I KNEW SHARED A MOTHER OR FATHER.

#### PIPPSEE

> GETTING ODDLY SPECIFIC NOW, AREN'T WE?

#### ERIOLANNA

> I'M JUST WORKING OVER IT.
> 
> TRYING TO FIND ANYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE.

#### PIPPSEE

> WELL IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE CURSED BUT A POWERFUL ENOUGH MAGIC COULD SLIP PAST MY NOTICE.

#### ERIOLANNA

> AND MINE TOO.

<BR><I>They gaze wistfully upon the mirror.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE IT?

#### ERIOLANNA

> WHEN I PUT IT BACK ON THE WALL.

#### PIPPSEE

> VERY FUNNY.

#### ERIOLANNA

> I THINK SO.
> 
> I DID NOT FEEL EVIL RADIATING FROM THE IMAGE.
> 
> IT MIGHT JUST BE A TRICK MIRROR.

#### PIPPSEE

> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A POWERFUL MAGIC TO EVADE OUR DETECTION.
> 
> WHY WOULD SOMEONE GO SO FAR AS TO MASK A MAGIC MEANT ONLY FOR AMUSEMENT?

#### ERIOLANNA

> I DON'T KNOW.

#### PIPPSEE

> MAYBE IT'S SIMPLY AN OLDER MAGIC WITH WHICH I'M UNFAMILIAR.

#### ERIOLANNA

> BUT I DON'T GET A FEELING FROM IT EITHER.

#### PIPPSEE

> THERE ARE MAGICS MORE ANCIENT THAN YOU.

#### ERIOLANNA

> OH, BY FAR.
> 
> JUST...FOR AN ARTIFACT LIKE THIS TO HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG IS, AS YOU PUT IT, IMPROBABLE.

#### PIPPSEE

> I TEND TO AGREE.

#### ERIOLANNA

> IT HAS NO OTHER HALLMARKS OF ANY BYGONE ERA WITH WHICH I'M FAMILIAR.
> 
> IT SEEMS CONSTRUCTED BY MEN, IF I WERE TO HAVE MY GUESS.

#### PIPPSEE

> IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A GNOMISH OR DWARVEN MAKE.

<BR><I>A hush falls over the two women. They are stumped.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY OF THE QUALITIES I'D EXPECT FROM A TRICK MIRROR.

<BR><I>She looks upon herself.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> NO, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

#### ERIOLANNA

> IF YOU WERE A GNOME.

#### PIPPSEE

> MY LADY; I AM A GNOME!

#### ERIOLANNA

> TODAY.

<BR><I>Pippsee assumes a smile of mock surrender.</i>

#### PIPPSEE

> WHAT DOES IT MEAN, THE PROCESS OF PRESENTING ONESELF TO OTHERS?
> 
> ANY GIVEN FACADE HAS A MEANING TO THE VIEWER THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD BY THE PRESENTER.
> 
> THE INVERSE, OF COURSE, IS ALSO TRUE.
> 
> AND EVEN IF IT COULD, IS IT ONE'S DUTY TO PRESENT A FACE SHE FINDS TRUTHY, OR SHOULD SHE CHOOSE A FACE OF FAMILIARITY FOR ANOTHER?
> 
> PERHAPS IT IS MOST USEFUL TO SELECT A MERRY BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

#### ERIOLANNA

> SO MANY OF YOUR KIND APPEAR AS ELVES.

#### PIPPSEE

> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO APPEAR AS YOU DO?

#### ERIOLANNA

> I LIKE A LITTLE VARIETY.

#### PIPPSEE

> YOU'RE PRETTY AND ALL, BUT...

#### ERIOLANNA

> PERHAPS I SAW ANOTHER SHAPESHIFTER.

#### PIPPSEE

> DOUBTFUL. 
> 
> I THINK YOU SAW YOURSELF WITH SOME SORT OF FOREIGN SHEEN WE CAN'T YET PLACE.

#### ERIOLANNA

> I SUPPOSE.

#### PIPPSEE

> IS THAT NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?

#### ERIOLANNA

> I DON'T KNOW.

#### PIPPSEE

> I AM WARY OF MAGICS THAT, BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, CAN'T BE SOURCED. 
> 
> I WOULD FEAR SOMETHING OF SUCH STRENGTH.

#### ERIOLANNA

> I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT.

#### PIPPSEE

> I MAY NOT BE SUITABLY VERSED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD...

#### ERIOLANNA

> OH ENOUGH OF THE HUMILITY.
> 
> YOU'RE PLENTY OLD ENOUGH.
> 
> DON'T WISH THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD UPON YOURSELF SO PREMATURELY.

#### PIPPSEE

> I SUPPOSE NOT.

#### ERIOLANNA

> YOU HAVEN'T STEERED ME WRONG YET.

#### PIPPSEE

> AND YET I STILL HAVE NO ANSWER TO THE STRANGER IN THE LOOKING GLASS.

#### ERIOLANNA

> IT WILL COME.
> 
> I AM NOT AFRAID.

#### PIPPSEE

> THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE THAT DESERVE OUR FEAR.

#### ERIOLANNA

> CERTAINLY.
