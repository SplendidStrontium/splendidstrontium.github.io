_The following is set to the tune of "My Sharona" by The Knack._

Ooh my little Queenie bee, Banshee Queen<br>
When ya gonna say it's yo time, Sylvanas?<br>
Ooh you make the undead run, but be a hon<br>
those golden val'kyr ain't thine, Sylvanas

Never gonna stop, blight it up, suck up all the life<br>
One gaze in her eyes, and you'll see, she can hypnotize<br>
M-m-m-my Sylvanas

Come a little closer, huh, a-will ya huh?<br>
Close enough betrays all those dyes, Sylvanas<br>
Won't ya let ya people be, let 'em free<br>
Your kinda lovin' is a lie, Sylvanas

(refrain)

(instrumental)

When ya gonna give to me, dark Lady<br>
Your pretty li'l head on a tine, Sylvanas?<br>
Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny<br>
Or is it that your coffin's guilt-lined, Sylvanas?

(refrain)

M-m-m-my Sylvanas...

(instrumental)

Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas<br>
Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas<br>
Oooo-ohhh, my Sylvanas
