<br>

For two years now, I've lived in fear. For two years now, I've known that my loose ends could very well come back to bite me.

The Dark Lady is out of the picture. She left Azeroth to seek her fortune in a very far off place. A place to which I was not looking forward to going.

The time has come for me to welcome the young mage with open arms. I followed her path once, before I was what I am now. She has been seeking council. And I will give it to her.
