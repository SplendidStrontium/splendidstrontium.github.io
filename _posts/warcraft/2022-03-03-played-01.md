As an aside before I jump back into World of Warcraft, I decided to do a small analysis of my playtime thus far. I have a sizeable lead due to the time I used to play in TBC. My total time played on the twenty-five toons enumerated here leads to a total playtime of 334 days, 13 hours, and 28 minutes. 

Goals in the new year include acquiring some more transmogs and finishing up basic Shadowlands requirements. 

I decided not to do a tally by faction as a number of these characters have faction-changed and so any tally I would do would be inherently disingenuous.

<table id="wow_table_played_01">
	<tr>
		<th>Rank</th>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Level</th>
		<th>Days</th>
		<th>Hours</th>
		<th>Minutes</th>
		<th>Pct Share</th>
	</tr>
	{% for wow-char in site.data.wow-played-2022-mar3.wow-chars %}
	<tr>
		<td>
			{{ wow-char.rank }}

		<td class="wowchar_name">

	{% endfor %}
