*****
<br><i>No one had ever taught me to cook. When I was a child, my mother brought me meals, and the whole process remained a mystery to me. When I became a vampire, I took vitae from Earth's creatures, and I was a thief, but I never committed murder. The Blood warmed me, and I needed no fire. But I could not live this way. When I resuccumbed to mortality, to the need to eat to survive, to... kill--it had been a difficult habit to acquire.</i>

<i>Hunger was repetitive and persistent. It seemed to me that as soon as I was done with one meal, I needed another. And another. Yes, I suppose it had been that way under the Vampiric Affliction, but it had not seemed so crude. So often I had to remove myself from whatever I was doing to satisfy this base need. And unlike the vitae, food left a lump in my stomach that slowed me, irritated me. I did not want to eat at first - my sense of taste was acute and easily perturbed; everything reminded me of rotting flesh. Textures were revolting and disgusted me. The pungent odors made me want to gag.</i>

<i>Yes, in the early days I had eaten only as was strictly necessary. My mother, long inured to the tedium of consumption, stressed the importance of three square meals. I rebelled, struggling against the yoke, but ultimately knew I had no choice. When she saw me skipping meals, she tried to stuff me with rich, fattening foods. She seemed to slip cheese into every nook and cranny of the things she prepared. When that didn't work, she insisted on protein supplements and vitamins. The bland taste and mild smell of those pseudofoods was tolerable and I took on much-needed weight. It was all still too sweet, but I had to find something I did feel an unholy abomination against the realm of foodstuff.</i>

<i>I hated the incessant need to chew and swallow. My teeth were sharp and I bit my cheeks in the same places over and over again. My teeth sang out in pain when a drink was too cold; my tongue was scalded from coffee others seemed to enjoy. I wanted to revolt, and yet, this is what I had chosen. This life was what I had wanted. I eventually fell into a rhythm. As my stamina and health improved, I stopped relying on my mother and began to cook for myself. At this, I had no natural gift and certainly no training. At first, my creations were barely edible, burnt on the outside and cold in the centers. As if in response to my mother's soulless but adequate meals, everything I forked into my mouth was overly-spiced and salty.</i>

<i>I continued to improve. I remained thin - my stomach would protest angrily when it had reached capacity - and I still resented that I could never stray too far from the kitchen - but the whole annoyance had slowly become bearable.</i>

<i>Tonight, I needed to eat something before making my way to the Blue Velvet. I had felt uneasy since midday - a greasy lunch from a restaurant had given me indigestion - but I knew I could not refuse dinner. I would get jittery and anxious. I could not afford to lose my focus tonight.</i>

<i>I choke down some calcium carbonate, don an apron, and get right into the process.</i>

<i>I am making butter chicken. I intend to go easy on the spice. I didn't like to consume the flesh of animals and generally avoided doing so if at all possible, but I could not refute that it was a nutrient-dense source of calories and was fairly easily digested. I had tried to live on carrots and cabbage, but that hadn't worked so well. No, this was yet another avenue of my life in which I was forced to make compromise.</i>

<i>My mother, at least, always joined me when she caught a new aroma wafting from the kitchen. She would have a tip or two, some helpful advice for me. Sometimes I took her suggestions, but other times I went my own way. Even as I listened to her pontificate on the joy - or lack thereof - of cooking, it was nice to have her company as I labored over the stove.</i>

<i>Often, it was just the two of us. Although I could now work the Craft as she could, we rarely had much to talk about. Our journeys were our own. I might cheerfully demonstrate a new transmutation or ask her advice on reference materials, but otherwise, the table was quiet. She seemed to always be preoccupied with her own thoughts and affairs and I refused to become a nuisance.</i>

<i>She would invariably perk up when my father would join us in the dining room. With him present, the lanes of conversation were wide open. He might break the ice with a baudy tale or a game of remember-when. She would follow up with a tender anecdote of something one of the children had done back-in-the-day. They would laugh and reminisce and though I was little more than window dressing in these conversations, I was glad to see them happy.</i>

<i>Tonight, my father mixes some kind of arcane cocktail for my mother. I can smell the alcohol heavy in the air. I am not interested.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> MOTHER, FATHER--
> 
> I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU BOTH ABOUT SOMETHING.

<br><i>My father sets his offering next to my mother's plate and takes a seat next to me, across from her.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> YES, KEVIN--
> 
> GO AHEAD.

<br><i>I take a breath and gather my confidence.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> MY FRIEND IN RIVERHEAD WHO TOOK THE CATS--
> 
> WELL, SHE'S MOVING.
> 
> SHE CAN'T TAKE THEM WITH HER.

<br><i>We had a house out east that I had used as a refuge when life in the city had been too overwhelming. Yes, I had gone out there often then, back several years ago when my father's soul had resided inside my mind. I had gone east on many a weekend, using the quiet to play at escape. Yes, I had taken him with me, as I always did then, but the ocean air had done me good. I had read books, scribed notes - and slept. I had good memories of that time. It had been just he and I - and the cats.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I WANT TO BRING THEM TO LIVE WITH US HERE.

<br><i>My mother's face curled in disgust.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> YOU WANT TO BRING CATS...
> 
> HERE?

<br><i>She had never been one to favor house pets.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> WITH THE--
> 
> LITTER?

<br><i>I sighed.</i>

#### KEVIN

> YES, I KNOW IT'S A BIT UNSIGHTLY--

#### MYRTLE 

> IT'S NOT JUST UNSIGHTLY, IT'S UNSANITARY.

#### KEVIN

> I'M NOT A FAN OF THE SMELL AND DUST EITHER, BUT--

<br><i>I had to pull at her heartstrings.</i>

#### KEVIN

> THEY'RE GETTING OLDER.
> 
> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO GET USED TO A NEW HOME AND NEW PEOPLE AT THEIR AGE.
> 
> NOT TO MENTION THEY'RE A BONDED PAIR. 
> 
> BROTHERS.
> 
> BEEN TOGETHER SINCE BIRTH.
> 
> WHAT IF SOMEONE ISN'T WILLING TO TAKE BOTH OF THEM?

<br><i>She eyed me with skepticism.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> I'VE NEVER...
> 
> OWNED A CAT.

<br><i>My father spoke brightly, trying to interject a little humor into my plea.</i>

#### VINCENT

> WITCHES HAVE BEEN KEEPING CATS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

<br><i>My mother grimaced.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> NOT <u>THIS</u> WITCH.

<br><i>My father turned up the charm.</i>

#### VINCENT

> OH, CATS AREN'T SO BAD.
> 
> THEY ARE CLEAN AND QUIET.
> 
> JUST LIKE YOU.

<br><i>She was not amused.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> I WOULD HARDLY REGARD A CREATURE THAT LICKS ITSELF AND SHITS IN A BOX TO BE CLEAN.

#### KEVIN 

> I'LL CLEAN UP AFTER THEM, BRUSH THEM, FEED THEM--
> 
> YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO A THING.

#### MYRTLE 

> I THOUGHT WHEN YOU ACQUIRED THE MONGRELS THAT THEY WERE TO STAY OUT EAST.

#### KEVIN 

> THE TWO OF THEM ARE HARDLY MONGRELS, MOTHER.
> 
> THEY'RE VERY SWEET, GENTLE CATS.
> 
> OUTSTANDING REPRESENTATIVES OF WHAT THE SPECIES CAN BE.
> 
> DOCILE, CALM.
> 
> AND...
> 
> I KNOW THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL IDEA BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.
> 
> I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE AS MUCH AS I USED TO, AND--

<br><i>She frowned, interrupting me.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> PLANS CHANGE?

<br><i>I didn't want to be impertinent, but--</i>

#### KEVIN 

> YEAH, MOM.
> 
> PLANS CHANGE. 
> 
> I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.
> 
> THEY'RE GOOD CATS.

<br><i>Her face was dark with rebellion.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> DOGS ARE MORE USEFUL.

#### KEVIN 

> I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE TIME OR PATIENCE FOR A DOG.
> 
> I MEAN--

<br><i>I backtracked, sensing the hypocrisy.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> IF YOU WANT TO GET A DOG, GET A DOG.
> 
> I'M NOT GOING TO STOP YOU.
> 
> BUT I NEED TO DO THIS.
> 
> THEY ARE MY CATS.

<br><i>She expelled air through her nose in irritation.</i>

#### MYRTLE

> I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THE OBSESSION WITH ANIMALS TO BE A GREAT WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND RESOURCES BETTER ALLOCATED TO OTHER PURSUITS.
> 
> THESE LITTLE GREMLINS ARE ACQUIRED BY THOSE WITHOUT THE MENTAL FORTITUDE TO FOCUS ON THE REAL NEEDS OF THIS WORLD.
> 
> THEY ARE SURROGATE CHILDREN TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO REMEMBER THE HUMANS LANGUISHING IN GROUP HOMES AND UNLOVING FAMILIES.

#### KEVIN 

> THE ANIMALS OF THIS PLANET NEED OUR HELP TOO.

#### MYRTLE 

> OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HUMANITY FIRST AND FOREMOST.

#### KEVIN

> THE CREATURES OF THIS WORLD ARE PART OF OUR HUMANITY.

#### MYRTLE 

> SEND THEM BACK TO THE WILDERNESS FROM WHICH THEY CAME.

#### KEVIN 

> THEY'RE DOMESTICATED.
> 
> WE DID THAT TO THEM.
> 
> WE CAN NO LONGER THROW THEM INTO THE FORESTS--

#### VINCENT

> ANY MORE THAN I CAN SEND YOU BACK TO A CAVE AND ARM YOU WITH A CLUB AND SPEAR.
> 
> DRESS YOU IN A LOINCLOTH.

<br><i>She pursed her lips, sensing her reservations about bringing animals into the house were falling on deaf ears.</i>

<i>She had to, reluctantly, admit defeat.</i>
