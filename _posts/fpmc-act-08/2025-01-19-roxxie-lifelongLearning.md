*****
<br><i>I awoke with a start. I could still feel the fear in my nerves; I had been dreaming. But what about? I tried to grab for the tendrils but there was nothing there - I had lost the vision to the sun.</i>

<i>I pushed the lid from my coffin and re-entered the bedroom. The pink walls made me uneasy but out of respect for the deceased, not to mention the ones that still remained, I would endure. Bob had wanted to return here, and so we had. I had some reluctance about claiming the bedroom of his dead wife, but there really had been no other options. He seemed to have no qualms about it, so who was I to make an issue where there wasn't one?</i>

<i>I ran my fingers through my cropped hair. The sun had recently set and I had the night ahead of me. When I had time in front of me, in my hands, rather than behind... this was the best feeling. The world was my oyster.</i>

<i>That is not to say I had total freedom. I had already made plans. I wanted to visit my Master in the Forgotten Hollow. I  had made a complete fool of myself at the holiday party. When the fire had broken out - I had turned tail and run. Like a yellow belly, I had taken flight and fled into the sky. I had abandoned the Count and shown myself a weakling. I hadn't been there when the Tremere summoned their demon and desecrated the Master's home. For all of my efforts to show myself worthy, when I had been needed, I had been scared shitless.</i>

<i>I apologized profusely to my Master, but none of that could alleviate the intensity of the shame I bore. He smiled gently and placed his hands on my shoulders, trying to reassure me that none of it was my fault. The fear of fire was perfectly rational, he reiterated.</i>

<i>And still, I resolved to myself that I must be better. Some of the coterie had withstood their terror. <u>They</u> had been there. <u>They</u> had fought. <u>They</u> had triumphed.</i>

<i>Maybe, though, I also needed to be patient with myself. So much had happened in these six short years. If I pushed myself too hard, I would break.</i>

<i>And that hinted at the deeper, unfortunate truth. I felt... fragile. Now that Makoa and Eliza were gone... Well - there went my graduating class. I was the only one left.</i>

<i>My phone buzzed angrily, temporarily quieting my anxieties. There was something soothing about having been issued a command - for a moment, no thought was necessary. The promise of peace lay just beyond the request.</i>

<i>It is my old friend. We had become close again over the past several years. It was sometimes difficult to refuse her invitations to afternoon coffee or sunrise on the boardwalk, but as time had passed, we'd developed an understanding. When I passed the evenings with her, I could forget about that enormous bestial bat who gorged herself on the blood of farm animals. In Ivette's company, I was smart, capable, and contained. I was... human.</i>

<br><i>That Ivette and her wife were fighting came as no surprise to me. Since we had reconnected, it seemed as if those two were anything but partners. If I were being totally honest with myself, sometimes I felt used. Ivette had a habit of seeking solace from me when she was in the doghouse and while part of me was glad I had become her constant companion, the other part winced in agony when she would be reinvited to the bedroom.</i>

*****
<br><i>Religion had always been... a sore subject. I suppose the most difficult thing about it was that it always reminded me of family. I had begun my life as a Catholic; bred, born, and baptised. But that had quickly worn out its welcome like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. I am not sure I ever believed in God. I know I tried - I fell to my knees and prayed into the sky, desperate for a sign, a reassurance that I was not throwing my faith into a black hole. The Messiah, the Saints, and even the Virgin - they had to have existed. So many sources agreed on this fact. But were they holy? And the miracles...? I wasn't sure.</i>

<i>The Toast & Caramel is a quiet, dusty old speakeasy hidden underneath an old church in Jamaica. Whether my Master had built the house of worship himself or rather acquired it in the dawning of the age of skepticism, I could not say. He could, and often did, walk there from his house on the hill. When the trip to the Blue Velvet was too arduous, he could often be found here, placing a new record on the player. I wasn't sure he had left Jamaica since he had done battle with the Hellbeast.</i>

<i>I figured my chances to find him here tonight were pretty good.</i>

<i>I sat in my car, jotting down some half-baked writing ideas in a notebook, until I see Ivette parallel park behind me. I stuff my pen and paper into the center console and exit the vehicle.</i>

<i>Ivette is a little confused.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> A...
> 
> CHURCH?

<br><i>I smiled, knowingly.</i>

#### ROXANNE

> IT ONLY LOOKS LIKE A CHURCH.
> 
> EVERYONE GATHERS DOWNSTAIRS.

#### IVETTE 

> HUH.
> 
> WEIRD.
> 
> I DON'T COME OUT TO JAMAICA MUCH.

#### ROXANNE 

> I DIDN'T EITHER UNTIL I STARTED WORKING FOR THE COUNT.

<br><i>Her eyes fell over the steeple with unease.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> SO...
> 
> A COUNT.
> 
> UH--
> 
> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS HIM?

#### ROXANNE 

> HE'S NOT REALLY A STICKLER FOR TITLES.
> 
> JUST CALL HIM WHATEVER FEELS NATURAL.

#### IVETTE 

> THAT'S...
> 
> NOT REALLY HELPFUL, BUT OKAY.

<br><i>I hold out my hands and bow, feeling a little silly, trying to encourage her to enter the church. She walks, cautiously.</i>

#### IVETTE

> SO...
> 
> HOW'D YOU GET HOOKED UP WITH THIS GIG, ANYWAY?

#### ROXANNE 

> INTERNET.

#### IVETTE

> SOME NOBLE FROM EUROPE WAS LOOKING TO HIRE A RANDO HE FOUND ON CRAIGSLIST?

<br><i>I laughed.</i>

#### ROXANNE

> HE'S A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

#### IVETTE 

> ... YEAH.

<br><i>I push open the heavy wooden door. It creaks loudly on the old hinges. Ivette shivers and tries to change the subject.</i>

#### IVETTE

> SO...
> 
> I--
> 
> UH--
> 
> SAW YOUR NEW POST.

<br><i>I had heard some advice long ago that you should always write for yourself. Barring that, write for someone special: your spouse, your Master, your... Friend.</i>

#### ROXANNE 

> THE ONE ABOUT GARDENING?

#### IVETTE 

> YEAH, YOU HAD SOME REALLY GOOD TIPS IN THERE.
> 
> I HAD NO IDEA RASPBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES WERE ANTAGONISTS.

#### ROXANNE 

> YEP, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PLANT TOGETHER.

#### IVETTE 

> I'VE BEEN MEANING TO START UP MY GARDEN.
> 
> GUESS IT'S A LITTLE COLD NOW BUT I SHOULD START PREPPING.
>
> THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I SWORE TO DO WHEN WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE.

<br><i>There was that word.</i>

<i>But there is no time to grimace. I put what she's said out of mind. We have descended the stairs and I am happy again.</i>

<i>My Master is here.</i>

<i>I rush forward when we enter the room and I see him sitting there. I will not touch him, not without invitation, if I can help it. But I run up to him, forgetting myself, as a little Childe.</i>

<i>He turns to me, granting me his face.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> ROXANNE.

#### ROXANNE 

> COUNT!
> 
> IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
> 
> HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?

#### STRAUD 

> I AM WELL.
> 
> THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF ME.

<br><i>I turn to Ivette.</i>

#### ROXANNE 

> IVETTE, THIS IS THE COUNT VLADISLAUS STRAUD IV. 
> 
> COUNT, THIS IS MY FRIEND, IVETTE CAMPBELL.

#### STRAUD 

> MISS CAMPBELL, IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO FINALLY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH YOU.
> 
> ROXANNE HAS TOLD ME NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS. 

<br><i>She blushed.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> OH--
> 
> UH...
>
> I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH TO SAY...

<br><i>I could not help but grin with satisfaction, watching the two of them interact.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> OH, AND SHE IS MODEST, TOO.
> 
> HOW CHARMING!

<br><i>I could tell he was not exactly what she had imagined.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> ROXANNE TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE WELL-VERSED IN THE LANGUAGES AND HISTORY OF THE FAR EAST. 
> 
> YOU TEACH AT THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY?

#### IVETTE

> Y-YEAH--
> 
> I'M AN ASSOCIATE.

#### STRAUD 

> THAT IS WONDERFUL.
> 
> DO YOU ENJOY YOUR WORK?

<br><i>She glanced at me, seeming puzzled by the question.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> YEAH--
> 
> I DO, MOST OF THE TIME.
> 
> I DON'T GET TO TRAVEL AS MUCH AS I USED TO, AND WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS CAN BE DRAINING...

<br><i>With my eyes, I tried to let her know she was doing fine.</i>

<i>She tries to perk up.</i>

#### IVETTE

> BUT IT IS REALLY REWARDING.
> 
> I'M GLAD I CHOSE THIS PATH.

#### STRAUD

> THERE IS NO GREATER VOCATION THAN ELEVATING OTHERS OUT OF IGNORANCE.

<br><i>He paused.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> MISS CAMPBELL, ARE YOU DRINKING ANYTHING OR WILL YOU FIND YOURSELF BEHIND THE WHEEL THIS EVENING?

#### IVETTE 

> UH--
> 
> YEAH, I SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE IT EASY.

#### STRAUD 

> ROXANNE, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

<br><i>I obliged without a word.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> PERHAPS SOMETIME I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE.
> 
> A LOVELY WOMAN FROM THE MIDDLE KINGDOM HAS BEEN STAYING WITH ME.
> 
> SHE HAS AN INTEREST IN OUR CULTURE AND ART.
> 
> I AM SURE THE TWO OF YOU WOULD HAVE MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

#### IVETTE 

> WELL, MY ACCENT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED...
> 
> I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO TEACH THE KIDS, BUT--

#### STRAUD 

> I AM SURE IT IS NOT SO BAD.
> 
> WE ARE OUR OWN WORST CRITICS.

<br><i>I return with glasses of water for Ivette and myself.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IS THIS THE FIRST TIME ROXANNE HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE?

#### IVETTE 

> YES, IT IS.
>
> I RECENTLY MOVED OUT TO NASSAU COUNTY BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT I NEVER REALLY FOUND MYSELF AROUND HERE MUCH.

#### STRAUD 

> YES, IT'S QUIET HERE, ISN'T IT?
>
> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THE AREA.
> 
> IF ONE IS NOT SUMMONED, ONE TENDS TO JUST FLY ON BY.

<br><i>Ivette didn't quite know what to say to that.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> SO, TELL ME:
> 
> HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND ROXANNE BEEN FRIENDS?

#### IVETTE 

> LONG TIME.

<br><i>Here, I was a little flustered and broke in.</i>

#### ROXANNE 

> WELL, WE HAD LOST TOUCH FOR A WHILE, BUT STARTED TALKING AGAIN A FEW YEARS BACK.
> 
> IVETTE WAS THE FIRST FRIEND I MADE WHEN I MOVED TO THE CITY.

#### STRAUD 

> THAT IS A SPECIAL THING.

#### ROXANNE 

> IVETTE WAS KIND TO ME...
> 
> WHEN I HAD NO ONE ELSE.

<br><i>I think I've embarrassed her.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> OH--
> 
> IT WASN'T ANYTHING...
> 
> I JUST DID WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO.
> 
> ...
> 
> YOU WERE NICE TO ME, TOO.

#### ROXANNE 

> IT MEANT A LOT TO ME THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS AN IDIOT FOR DROPPING OUT.
> 
> DIDN'T TELL ME I WAS MAKING THE WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
>
> DIDN'T TELL ME I'D REGRET IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
> 
> OTHERS DID.
>
> JUST TOUGH IT OUT, THEY SAID.
> 
> IT COULDN'T BE THAT BAD!

#### IVETTE 

> PEOPLE LEAVE FOR THEIR OWN REASONS.
> 
> LIFE IS HARD.
> 
> I WON'T LIE, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A FEW TIMES.

#### ROXANNE 

> OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

#### IVETTE

> NO, REALLY!
> 
> I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A BREAK, GET A JOB WAITING TABLES FOR A COUPLE YEARS, MEET PEOPLE; YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY ENJOY BEING YOUNG.
>
> HAVE SOME FUN FOR ONCE.
>
> THEN I'D GO BACK LATER WHEN I WAS READY TO PUT MY HEAD TO STUDYING.

#### ROXANNE 

> WELL, YOU MADE IT THROUGH.
> 
> AND YOU'RE A PROFESSOR NOW!

#### IVETTE 

> HA--
> 
> I GUESS.
> 
> I DON'T REALLY HAVE MANY OTHER FRIENDS FROM THAT TIME.
> 
> YOU AND LATOYA.
> 
> THAT'S ABOUT IT.

<br><i>I didn't relish being put in that category, and my mind stutters.</i>

<i>Luckily, Ivette turned to the Master.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> LATOYA IS MY WIFE.

<br><i>He raised an eyebrow.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> YOUR WIFE?
> 
> YOU SEEM TO ME FAR TOO YOUNG TO BE ALREADY MARRIED.

<br><i>Ivette shrugged in surrender.</i>

#### IVETTE 

> OVER TEN YEARS NOW.

#### STRAUD 

> TEN YEARS?
> 
> MY MY.
> 
> YOUR DEDICATION IS REMARKABLE.
> 
> I, MYSELF, HAVE NEVER ENTERED INTO THE BONDS OF HOLY MATRIMONY.
> 
> OVER THE YEARS, I'VE KNOWN MANY DELIGHTFUL INDIVIDUALS AND WE'VE PASSED THE HOURS TOGETHER IN HARMONY, AND YET, ON THIS DAY, MY BED IS DUSTY AND UNKEMPT.
> 
> PERHAPS I MAKE MYSELF TOO BUSY.
> 
> PERHAPS I AM TOO PICKY.
> 
> OR PERHAPS, NOW IN THE TWILIGHT OF MY YEARS, I FEAR IT IS TOO LATE AND IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO SADDLE SOMEONE I CLAIM TO LOVE WITH THE INEVITABLE...

<br><i>I couldn't disagree with him more but did not dare interject...</i>

#### STRAUD 

> BUT ENOUGH OF MY LAMENTATIONS.
> 
> WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN?

#### IVETTE 

> I'M GETTING BACK INTO THE GYM...

#### ROXANNE 

> IVETTE AND I WERE GOING TO THE POOL HALL BUT IT WAS CLOSED FOR THE WEEK.

#### STRAUD 

> PERHAPS I OUGHT TO PUT IN SOME GAMES HERE.

#### IVETTE 

> YOU...
> 
> OWN THIS PLACE?

<br><i>He smiled.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

#### IVETTE 

> I THOUGHT YOU OWNED THAT BAR IN ASTORIA.

#### STRAUD 

> THE BLUE VELVET.
> 
> HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

#### IVETTE 

> NO, NOT YET.

#### STRAUD

> WELL, IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THIS PLACE.

> THERE, I MAKE MY MONEY.

> WITH A NAME LIKE YOURS...
> 
> ISN'T YOUR TIME WORTH MORE?

#### STRAUD

> YOU FLATTER ME.
> 
> CERTAINLY TIME IS OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET, BUT YOU ARE MISLED IF YOU BELIEVE MY TITLE IS WORTH MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY.

> TO USE A TURN OF PHRASE, I OFTEN, AS YOU WOULD SAY, AM FORCED TO TAKE MY WORK HOME WITH ME.

<br><i>I hoped she would not be too impetuous here. She had contempt for the gentry and was convinced that he worked me as a dog, despite my protestations to the contrary. As she saw it, <u>he</u> was the reason I couldn't meet her for midday brunch.</i>
