*****
<br>It was mind-boggling to me that you brought Vincent back to life. Thanks for that.

I don't know that I'm definitely getting For Rent, the truth is that I'm very much enjoying playing the three(3) best packs, and those are Vampires, Realm of Magic, and City Living.

The new For Rent world could be Brooklyn. It is unknown to me.

<br><i>I walk outside my house and down the street to the site of a small church. Cedric will be just a moment from his temporary stay in the Vatore Mansion.</i>

<i>Soon, he arrives. We stand together in silence outside the graveyard for some time.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> WHEN WILL YOU OPEN THE PLACE AGAIN?

<br><i>I paused.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> I DON'T KNOW.

#### CEDRIC 

> IT'S WINDY OUT HERE.

#### STRAUD

> YES, THE WEATHER IS CHANGING. 
> 
> LET'S HEAD INSIDE.

<br><i>The Toast & Caramel, built in the remains of a stone church, stood as proof that Vampire could stand within a chapel a not be set aflame or otherwise smited therein from a heavenly source. You had to pass through the nave to access the secret rooms within.</i>

<i>It had served as a bar for those in the know for quite some time but then had mysteriously closed. Or at least, that's what I made it appear to be. I wanted everyone out.</i>

<i>Once we made it inside the heavy doors, I made my intended speaking topic abundantly clear.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> I AM THINKING OF CALLING IN A FAVOR THAT IS OWED TO ME.

#### CEDRIC 

> WHO OWES YOU A FAVOR?

#### STRAUD 

> NO ONE EXPLICITLY OWES ME A FAVOR, IN THAT WAY. I AM OWED A FAVOR BY VIRTUE OF EXISTING, NOT TOO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ANYONE DOES. IT IS A GRAND AND TIRING CIRCUS, THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNIVERSE. I HAVE DONE A LOT IN MY DAY AND I'VE NO INTENTION OF STOPPING, BUT YET... YES. I HAVE FRIENDS.

#### CEDRIC 

> WHAT WILL YOU ASK FOR?

#### STRAUD 

> NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.
