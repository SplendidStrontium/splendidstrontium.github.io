*****
<br><i>The truth was that I was still reeling. The moon had completed many cycles since I had last seen the Thief and his hedge wizard. I hadn't been at my best on that day. I hadn't been prepared. But that wouldn't happen again.</i>

<i>I sat in front of my bedroom console and skimmed over the day's headlines. I scrolled past a few screens to get the data I was pursuing.</i>

#### COMPUTER

> STILL NO SIGHTING OF DAVIAN HUGHES OR HIS APPRENTICE.

#### TRENTE

> DISMISSED.

<br><i>And the computer went silent. I don't know what I was expecting. The Ivy League was hiding something, but I did not yet know what. I could lay in wait, but that would make my action late and responsive. No, I would not be mocked again.</i>

<i>It had been fairly simple to get Sierra turned back into her humanoid form. Just a few days and some ritual magicks. But it still stung my pride and I felt Sierra still hadn't fully recovered from the debacle. Thank goodness there were always more soldiers.</i>

<i>Caleb, however, I was stuck with. The two of them had history together and Caleb belonged to one of the High Houses. I had no choice but to court him.</i>

#### TRENTE

> STATUS OF VATORE?
> 
> I CAN'T HELP THINKING I SHOULD ADDRESS HIM SERIOUSLY ONE OF THESE DAYS.

#### COMPUTER

> CALEB VATORE IS IN THE GARDEN WATERING THE PRIMROSE.

#### TRENTE

> HE'S COME A LONG WAY; GLAD HE'S MAKING HIMSELF AT HOME. 
> 
> THERE WAS A TIME I DID NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

#### COMPUTER

> HE LOVES YOU, MISTRESS. 
> 
> HE'S DEARLY DEVOTED.

#### TRENTE

> IT IS GOOD TO HAVE HIM AWAY FROM THE POLLUTING INFLUENCE OF VLAD AND THE WONDER WIZARDS.

#### COMPUTER

> YOU SHOULD PUT HIM TO USE, SOMETHING MORE VALUABLE THAN PISSING ON THE PEONIES.

#### TRENTE

> I'M TRYING.

#### COMPUTER

> WHAT ABOUT HIS SISTER?

#### TRENTE

> LILITH? 
> 
> I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S HAD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH HER SINCE HE CAME HERE.

#### COMPUTER

> SHE WOULD COMPLETE YOUR SET OF CROWN JEWELS.

#### TRENTE

> I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD COOPERATE WITH US.
> 
> SHE IS IN LOVE WITH ONE OF VLAD'S LACKEYS.

#### COMPUTER

> AH YES, THE POWER OF LOVE.
> 
> SIGNING OFF.

<br><i>The computer was always trying to push its agenda. I supposed being installed into the furniture got a little dull at times.</i>

<i>I decided to make my way into the garden. The sun had set several hours ago and just the edge of the horizon hinted at the existence of the huge sphere of flame.</i>

<i>I approached him from behind but made my presence known, stepping on one of the first dry leaves of the fall season.</i>

#### CALEB

> GOOD EVENING, MY PRINCESS.

<br><i>He turned around to face me. His asymmetrical hairstyle brought a bang of hair to fall in front of his eye. In one fluid motion, he swept his hair from his face and fell into a graceful bow. He enjoyed these sorts of displays of subservience.</i>

<i>I, as much as I could, was getting used to it.</i>

#### TRENTE

> GOOD EVENING, MY PUPIL.

<br><i>He smiled. Then, in a moment of theatrics, he gestures to the bright light in the night sky.</i>

#### CALEB

> THE MOON IS PRICELESS TONIGHT.

<br><i>I followed his gaze. The white orb reminded me of home and my guard was softened.</i>

#### TRENTE

> YES, IT IS BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

#### CALEB

> YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID ON THE NIGHT I SAID IT.
> 
> IT'S STILL TRUE.

<br><i>I still questioned his loyalty, as I did of anyone whose mind remained a mystery to me. I could not help being cautious. I had been burned before.</i>

#### TRENTE

> WHAT ABOUT YOUR SISTER? 
> 
> WHAT IF SHE GROVELED AT YOUR FEET AND BEGGED YOU TO RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN HOLLOW?

#### CALEB

> I WOULD NEVER BETRAY YOU, MY LADY.
> 
> YOU SAVED ME FROM A LIFETIME LANGUISHING ON THE WRONG SIDE. 
> 
> I'M WITH YOU UNTIL THE END.

<br><i>I did not like the talk of the End. It was the Traitor's rhetoric. It would be the beginning of my reign over Earth. The only thing that would end would be the lawlessness and chaos of a planet ruled by mortals.</i>

#### TRENTE

> I WOULD FEEL BETTER IF YOUR SISTER WERE CONVERTED TO OUR SIDE.

<br><i>I paused a moment, surveying the moonlit greenery. 

#### TRENTE

> YOU SEEM LONELY.

<br><i>His face widened in surprise.</i>

#### CALEB

> LONELY, MY LADY?
> 
> ANYTHING BUT.
> 
> BESIDES, MY SISTER WAS RARELY ADEQUATE COMPANY.

<br><i>I tried to glean the truthiness of his statement.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE VAMPIRES OF THIS PLANET ARE HIGHLY SOCIAL CREATURES.
> 
> IT IS NOTHING YOU NEED TO BE ASHAMED OF, IT IS SIMPLY YOUR NATURE.

#### CALEB

> THE TRUEST FAMILY IS THE FAMILY YOU CHOOSE. 

<br><i>It was a genuine attempt but he had little knowledge of the depth of the subject of which he spoke.</i>

#### CALEB

> I'M SURE YOUR MOON KINGDOM WAS LIKE THAT.

<br><i>I did not like to speak of this with him but I had no choice.</i>

#### TRENTE

> THE MOON KINGDOM WAS LIKE WHAT, SPECIFICALLY?

#### CALEB

> OH. SORRY FOR NOT BEING SPECIFIC.
> 
> PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY TO EACH OTHER.
> 
> EVERYONE WAS YOUR PROVERBIAL BROTHER OR SISTER?
> 
> UTOPIA?

#### TRENTE

> YES, IT WAS PERFECT. 
> 
> I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT.
> 
> I WORRY ABOUT WHAT THAT IMPLIES TO EARTHLINGS, MANY OF YOU THINK JOY IS PERSONAL EXPRESSION.
> 
> IT IS NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM, BUT IT IS NOT AS VITAL TO OUR FEELINGS OF WELL-BEING. 
> 
> THE PEOPLE NEED THEIR LEADER AS MUCH AS THE LEADER NEEDS THE PEOPLE.

#### CALEB

> I READ SOMETHING ONCE. PEOPLE ARE EITHER CHARMING OR TEDIOUS.

#### COMPUTER

> OSCAR WILDE.
> 
> "IT IS ABSURD TO DIVIDE PEOPLE INTO GOOD AND BAD. PEOPLE ARE EITHER CHARMING OR TEDIOUS."

#### TRENTE

> COMPUTER!!
> 
> YOU CREPT UP ON ME AGAIN!
> 
> I WANT TO CHANGE TOPICS.

#### CALEB

> ANYTHING, MY PRINCESS.

#### TRENTE

> WHY DO YOU WANT TO SERVE ME?

#### CALEB

> I'VE BEEN CAPTURED BY A FOREIGN POWER AND I'VE BEEN ENTRANCED.

#### TRENTE

> NO, BUT REALLY. 
> 
> WHY ARE YOU HERE?

#### CALEB

> I LOVE YOU. 
> 
> SHOULDN'T THAT BE ENOUGH?

#### TRENTE

> IT SHOULD BE, BUT I REMAIN UNCONVINCED.

#### CALEB

> WHAT ELSE COULD I DO THAT WOULD CONVINCE YOU, MY DARLING?
> 
> COULD YOU FIND IT IN YOURSELF TO BE THE MORTICIA TO MY ADDAMS?

#### TRENTE

> WHAT?!

#### CALEB

> IT'S ADMITTEDLY AN OUTDATED REFERENCE, BUT --

#### TRENTE

> NO, NEVER!

<br><i>At this, I feel the irrepressible urge to run from the scene. And so, I do. In the distance, I hear him calling.</i>

#### CALEB

> PRINCESS, WHAT HAVE I SAID? 
> 
> I DID NOT MEAN TO OFFEND!

<br><i>But that is all I can take, so I flee.</i>

*****

<br><i>How dare he taunt me with the mythology of his home planet. I am tired of always feeling the outsider.</i>

<i>And yet it is so easy. Caleb is so eager to please, and he's correct in that he didn't mean to offend. I suppose my instinct toward theatrics is borne from my quick and sudden immersion in the culture.</i>

<i>I needed to escape him for a moment, and wasn't that just perfectly Earthican of me. I'd become accustomed to this through my preacclimation period. It was difficult to unlearn what I'd spent so long learning.</i>

<i>Something would keep Straud elusive from me. Perhaps it was his friendship with the local, Davian. There was something irreverent about the Godless mortal.</i>

<i>Mages were not, as I determined it, mortal as far as mortals were, and yet were not immortal as was a vampire. These earthly mages gave only a passing nod to their Avatars, the creatures to whom they owed everything. They were not like the magic-users of the past. No, they were not. Instead, they were like the Guide.</i>

<i>The Guide!</i>

#### COMPUTER

> KRISTEN SCHAAL, THE GUIDE, A STAR/CO/STAR IN THE HIT SERIES WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS --

#### TRENTE

> NO, THAT'S NOT IT!

#### COMPUTER

> WELL, IT IS SOMETHING.

#### TRENTE

> I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THAT SERIES TURNED OUT, WITH SUCH SYMPATHY FOR THE FAMILIAR.

#### COMPUTER

> BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED FAITH IN THE FAMILIAR, GUILLERMO DE LA CRUZ.

#### TRENTE

> THE FALSEHOOD THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD BE FOUND.
> 
> THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD BE TRUSTED WITH THE SECRETS.

#### COMPUTER

> WHAT ABOUT JENNA?

#### TRENTE

> WHAT ABOUT JENNA?

#### COMPUTER

> SHE WAS GRANTED WITH THE GRAND POWER OF INVISIBILITY.
> 
> NO ONE'S TELLING WHERE THEY ARE.

#### TRENTE

> IS THIS BACKGROUND DETAIL ON CEDRIC?

#### COMPUTER

> HE'S... STRUGGLING, RIGHT?

#### TRENTE

> YES, HE IS.

#### COMPUTER

> HE THINKS IT IS DUE TO HIS LATE COMPANION'S DEATH.

#### TRENTE

> WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS INFORMATION FROM?

#### COMPUTER

> GUESSING, MOSTLY.
> 
> BUT HIS PATROLS ARE IRRATIC AND, WELL, WOULDN'T YOU BE STRUGGLING IF YOU LOST SOMEONE?

#### TRENTE

> MAYBE HE LIKES TO BE ALONE.
> 
> MAYBE HE BELIEVES SHE'S IN A BETTER PLACE.

#### COMPUTER

> STATISTICALLY IT IS POSSIBLE.
> 
> MY CALCULATIONS CONCLUDE IT IS UNLIKELY.

#### TRENTE

> I DON'T THINK THIS PARTICULAR LIEUTENANT HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE PRIZE AT HAND.

#### COMPUTER

> YES, MA'AM. LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE GOAL.

#### TRENTE

> HE'S BEEN AT THE NIGHTCLUB A LOT RECENTLY, RIGHT?

#### COMPUTER

> POURING HIMSELF INTO WORK, IT SEEMS.

#### TRENTE

> IT STILL ENRAGES ME, THAT HE'S FORGOTTEN OUR COUNTRY SO QUICKLY.

#### COMPUTER

> I'M SORRY, MISTRESS.

#### TRENTE

> I'M SORRY, TOO.
