*****

<br><i>Now it was again approaching winter. Last winter had culminated in the great finale at Trelaine's cathedral in Brooklyn.</i>

<i>For so long I had felt numb. Unable to do much more than was the minimum required maintenance each day. Cedric had moved out a while back, leading to her alone in the house with cats. She hadn't expected her life to be so circular.</i>

<i>Ah but this time she was tasked with protecting the Marscapones.</i>

<br><i>His mission took him elsewhere. No hard feelings. </i>

<i>Marching around the house was a little more difficult than usual. And that's saying something, as her body was loathesome and sluggish. She was a curious creation of fang and gear. This body would be her prison.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">Yeah, that must be difficult, you and the house, alone against the world. Maybe you ought to strike up a friendship with the Marscapones. Maybe they can help you with your ills.

<br><i>It had happened upon her fears more than twice. But she had tried to console herself, thinking maybe that's the way it was supposed to be. </i>
