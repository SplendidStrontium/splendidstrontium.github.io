*****
<br><i>At this point, I had been in New Jersey for... well. Years. There were still things that mystified me - the dividers on the highways, the full-service gas stations, and where exactly that local twang came from. Though I still felt a stranger, an implant, I smiled and kept on. Love had brought me here and love would make me remain.</i>

<i>My childhood had been quiet and lonely. I had my father, my sister, and occasionally my cousins, but growing up in Straud's realm had left me isolated. I never knew the joy of spontaneous friendship, the kinds of bonds that are formed on playgrounds and over schoolbooks. Such camaraderie was the stuff of books and fairytales. And reading never came easily to me; letters and figures danced around before my eyes and made me regret having opened the tomes in the first place.</i>

<i>But I deeply desired to visit the foreign places I had heard rumor of. Father would read aloud to me and by candlelight, white castles rose from fields of green and valiant knights vanquished evil. And, of course, I dreamt of a princess.</i>

<i>I think everyone yearns to be loved. I know I did. I strove to be good when I was bad, brave when I was scared, experienced when I was ignorant, all in the hopes of earning the favor of someone fair and kind.</i>

<i>Even after I had grown tall, I knew I didn't always make the right decisions. I suppose my Father would say I was thinking with my heart rather than my head. But I had never looked inside myself to see if I even possessed such organs. If they had ever once worked, they certainly didn't work anymore.</i>

<i>Somewhere, deep inside my inner feelings, I had regrets about coming here. Sometimes I was deeply afraid, even terrified, of Trente Gagarin. If I could say one thing of Straud and his lackeys, it was that they were predictable. They were exactly what they presented themselves to be: Cedric was an obnoxious asshole, Mandarc was afraid of his own shadow, and Straud - well, Straud was Straud.</i>

<i>But Trente was different. I had discovered that fact soon after coming to live here with her. It was not just her temper - I had seen her snap at me plenty of times before - nor was it simply the drawing back of the curtain. I had lived with my sister so I liked to think I was not entirely bewildered by the opposite sex - but Trente was something else entirely.</i>

<i>She ruled over the house with an iron fist. Everyone seemed to revolve around her like little planets. The Charm girls asked her to help them with their homework. Eriolanna sought advice on what foods to buy, which programs they should watch, how to best dress the children. And me? I fell right into the routine.</i>

<i>I adored Trente. I always had. I loved how her rose-colored hair curled into the small of her back. I loved how she commanded respect from everyone around her. I loved to hear her laugh at her own jokes when she thought she'd said something funny. But maybe most of all, I loved to watch the others grovel at her feet. Yes, <u>that</u> was my favorite.</i>

*****

#### TRENTE 

> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, CALEB? 

<br><i>She came up behind me but did not startle me. I had known she was there. I had heard her in the bathroom. I had heard her sorting through her closet.</i>

#### CALEB

> OH, JUST PLAYING A GAME.

#### TRENTE 

> ONE OF YOUR SIMULATORS?

#### CALEB

> YEAH, MY PEOPLE SIM JUST GOT AN UPDATE.

#### TRENTE 

> FASCINATING.

<br><i>I could hear her walking closer to me but I did not want to pause yet; I was in the middle of doing something.</i>

#### CALEB 

> THEY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED LOADING TIMES ACROSS THE BOARD.
> 
> SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN SKIPPABLE NOW, WHICH IS AWESOME.
> 
> AND THEY ADDED A NEW TUTORIAL--

#### TRENTE 

> NEAT-O.

<br><i>I can feel her now right behind me, but I'm still not quite finished. She looks at my screen.

#### TRENTE 

> EVERYONE LOOKS SO HAPPY THERE.

#### CALEB

> YEAH, I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE KIDDIE BUT IT'S A BIG NOSTALGIA HIT FOR ME.
>
> TAKES ME BACK--

#### TRENTE 

> TO... WHERE, EXACTLY?

<br><i>She has pressed her naked breasts against my back. I can feel her warmth on the back of my neck. She was not always like this, usually she was just as cold as the rest of us, but at other times...</i>

<i>I totally forgot what she had asked me.</i>

#### CALEB 

> UM...
> 
> WHAT?

<br><i>She brings her cheek against the side of my face and now I can feel her jaw move as she whispers to me.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I ASKED:
> 
> WHAT DOES THE GAME MAKE YOU REMEMBER?

<br><i>Right, I mentioned nostalgia.</i>

#### CALEB 

> UH...
> 
> WELL--
> 
> NOTHING IN PARTICULAR, JUST...
> 
> Y'KNOW.
> 
> WHEN I WAS YOUNG...

<br><i>She runs her hands down my sides, starting at my shoulders and then slowly working her way down my arms.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DID YOU LIKE BEING YOUNG?

<br><i>The game is still running but I cannot pause it. All I can do is watch it tick through.</i>

#### CALEB 

> IT WAS...
> 
> OKAY...

#### TRENTE 

> JUST...
> 
> OKAY?

<br><i>In an instant, she flips around and appears in my lap, legs on either side of my body. Sometimes she liked to wear a negligee of lace and silk, but that day was not today.</i>

<i>She was heavy, but her weight was not burdensome. Rather, she was just exceptionally... present - there on my legs, her warm skin radiating through my clothing.</i>

#### CALEB 

> UH...
> 
> UM...

<br><i>Youth - young - being young - childhood?</i>

<i>Her blue eyes pierced my resolve. Her lips were ruby-red, and she smiled, hiding her fangs.</i>

#### CALEB 

> IT WAS...
> 
> ALRIGHT, BUT...
> 
> I THINK I LIKE BEING AN ADULT MORE.

<br><i>She flutters her eyelids, her lashes seeming to scintillate in the low light.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> YES, I THINK SO TOO.

<br><i>She lingers for a moment and then becomes light as a feather, leaping from my lap with a quick but flamboyant gesture.</i>

<i>She lands very precisely in a set of black heels, facing away from me. Her back is covered in a shower of pink hair, but her rump and the back of her knees kept the pose obscene.</i>

<i>I swivel in my chair to take in the view, watching her with rapt attention.</i>

<i>As for the video game, I could always reload from the last save.</i>

#### TRENTE

> SO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES...
> 
> NEVER ENOUGH TIME...
> 
> BUT I DO THINK THE POSITIVES OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES...

<br><i>She walks very slowly away from me, taking great care to sway her hips and place one foot in front of the other.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DON'T YOU?

<br><i>Positives... Negatives...</i>

#### CALEB 

> ...

<br><i>She removes a sheer robe from a hook and wraps it around herself. The garment is embellished with delicate white feathers. I am silent as she places her hands underneath her hair and lifts so that it again trails down her back.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB?

<br><i>I tried to remember what we'd been talking about.</i>

#### CALEB 

> ... WHAT?

<br><i>She turns her head so that I can see her in profile.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DO YOU KNOW THE WORST PART ABOUT BEING A CHILD?

<br><i>I supposed she didn't really want my answer here.</i>

#### CALEB 

> W-WHAT--
> 
> YOUR... UHM...
> 
> M-MA-MAJESTY?

<br><i>She turns around to face me and because she has no belt, she holds her lingerie shut.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> WE HADN'T YET FOUND EACH OTHER.

<br><i>I think my mouth was hanging open. It felt... dry.</i>

#### CALEB 

> WELL... 
> 
> I SUPPOSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT M-ME, BUT...
> 
> I'D SEEN YOU IN MY DREAMS.

<br><i>She smiled and began to walk toward me, letting the garment flow freely.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> AND...
> 
> YOU WAITED FOR ME, DIDN'T YOU CALEB?

<br><i>I try to swallow but it doesn't seem to do much.</i>

#### CALEB

> Y-YES, YOUR MAJESTY.
> 
> I WAS SURE YOU WERE REAL.

<br><i>She smiled.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> SO BEAUTIFUL, THAT...
> 
> LOYALTY.

<br><i>She ran her tongue over her red lips, enunciating the next thing she said.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I LOVE IT.

<br><i>I said nothing.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB?

<br><i>She sat down on the floor before me with the utmost grace. She places one hand splayed out on the floor to support herself and runs the other up my pantleg.</i>

<i>It tickles.</i>

#### CALEB

> Y-YES?

<br><i>She tugs at my clothing.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.
> 
> IS THAT OKAY?

<br><i>Why would she even bother asking me for permission? I smile weakly on just one side of my face.</i>

#### CALEB 

> Y-YEAH...
> 
> A-A-ANYTHING...

<br><i>She runs her hands back down my leg and removes my slippers. We sit in silence for a moment, and then we lock eyes.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A BABY.

<br><i>Uh... What? My mind goes blank. Completely blank.</i>

#### CALEB 

> YOU WANT A WHAT?

#### TRENTE 

> A BABY, CALEB. 
>
> I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A BABY.

<br><i>I'm so confused, so stupified, I do something incredibly foolish.</i>

<i>I laugh.</i>

#### CALEB 

> YOU WANT A WHAT?

<br><i>Her face becomes serious. She frowns and withdraws her touch. She speaks very carefully.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> A BABY, CALEB.
> 
> I WANT A BABY.

<br><i>It was kind of hard to match her mood here. I suppose I was so uncomfortable it was all I could do to open my mouth in some dumb dopey grin, completely baffled. </i>

#### CALEB 

> TRENTE--
> 
> WE'RE...
> 
> VAMPIRES.

<br><i>Her eyebrows drew together in displeasure. Her blue eyes glowered at me.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

<br><i>Shit. I'd made her angry.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO?

<br><i>I'd insulted her.</i>

#### CALEB 

> NO--
> 
> I--

<br><i>She reaches up, takes hold of my pants, and pulls. The clothing comes off in one fell swoop. She leaves it on the floor between us.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> ARE YOU...

<br><i>She opens her mouth, revealing her perfectly white, extremely sharp, fangs. And her eyes seemed to glow as tiny embers.</i>

#### TRENTE

> REFUSING ME?

<br><i>She climbs up to her knees and places her body between my naked legs. I can feel that heat.</i>

#### CALEB

> N-NO!
> 
> I WOULD NEVER REFUSE YOU!
> 
> YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT!

<br><i>I sat there in my computer chair and I am very aware that the only thing that divides us is a pair of flimsy boxer shorts. Not that I thought that would stop her.</i>

#### CALEB 

> ... JUST--

<br><i>She may have been a moon princess, my fairytale Queen, an angel from another dimension, but me?</i>

#### CALEB

> I...
> 
> UH...

<br><i>I looked down in shame.</i>

#### CALEB

> I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT.

<br><i>My gaze wandered to the side, into the room, the furniture, the paintings...</i>

#### TRENTE 

> AND WHY NOT?

#### CALEB

> ... BECAUSE--

<br><i>I looked toward my leg, speckled with a thin layer of hair.</i>

#### CALEB

> I DON'T THINK I MAKE...
> 
> SEMEN.

<br><i>She thrust her hand between my legs, her thumb around my erect member and her fingers wrapped around my testicles.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE ARE FOR?

<br><i>Our eyes now met. I stammered. I was not in any condition to answer her questions.</i>

#### CALEB

> WELL...
>
> W-WE WERE M-MADE IN THEIR IMAGE--

<br><i>Her eyes burned with fury.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> WRONG, CALEB!

<br><i>I could feel her nails press ever so slightly into my scrotum.</i>

#### TRENTE

> WRONG!

<br><i>She dismounts me and stands before me, her lingerie falling about her naked frame. She points toward herself emphatically.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> THEY WERE MADE IN <u>OUR</u> IMAGE!
>
> GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL!

#### CALEB 

> I...
> 
> UH...
> 
> BUT, MY LADY--

<br><i>She tuts to reprimand me.</i>

#### CALEB

> YOUR HIGHNESS--
> 
> I'VE NEVER--

<br><i>I felt a stiffness in my muscles as if blood would rise to my cheeks, but it never happens.</i>

#### CALEB 

> I'VE NEVER--

<br><i>I hated words.</i>

#### CALEB

> EJACULATED.

<br><i>She looked at me, and her expression softened into what I could only assume was pity.</i>

#### TRENTE

> NEVER?
> 
> YOU'VE NEVER COME TO CLIMAX?

<br><i>I looked at her pleadingly.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> NOT ONCE?
> 
> NOT EVEN... BEFORE?

<br><i>I pulled down my t-shirt. It had come askew when she had leapt from my person.</i>

<i>I cannot escape.</i>

#### CALEB

> N-NO, MY HIGHNESS.

<br><i>I felt tiny.</i>

#### CALEB

> NEVER.

<br><i>She folded her arms beneath her breasts, looking away and sparing me those intense eyes.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> HUMPF.

<br><i>Then she turned away, going to retrieve one of her long silken dressing gowns from the wall.</i>

<i>I did not have anything to say, it had been completely exhausting to get this far.</i>

<i>She speaks quietly without looking at me, but with an odd determination.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> WELL, THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.

<br><i>My eyebrows raise in astonishment.</i>

#### CALEB

> YOUR--

<br><i>I attempt to address her but she interjects and I forget myself a moment, my mouth hanging open.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> ONE THING OF MANY.

<br><i>She looked at me now, each of us no longer strained by the nakedness.</i>

#### TRENTE

> I'M GOING TO CHANGE THAT, CALEB.

<br><i>I looked at her, feeling helpless.</i>

#### CALEB 

> HOW?
> 
> HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE ME?

<br><i>She smiled gently, raising her hand to beckon me.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> COME HERE.

<br><i>I did as she asked. She was still wearing those shoes.</i>

<i>She laid her head against me and began to stroke my  hair. My hands found their way first to her shoulders, then around her back. Her body was cooler now, but I could still feel her heat, just slightly more than my own. Her hair smelled of lavender.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I HAVE IDEAS.

*****
<br><i>Friday Perkins had arrived about a month and a half ago. As I understood it, the new house located just down the way from ours belonged to her. I had, years ago, met her a handful of times but even then I hadn't had much to say. It had been strange to have a mage in the Forgotten Hollow but it hadn't been my business. She was Mandarc's girl.</i>

<i>I had later heard that she'd run off with some wizard and gone to the Midwest. And I had assumed that was the end of that.</i>

<i>The world of the Enchanted seemed very separate from my own. There were times it intersected my quite dull existence, I suppose. I stepped out of my comfort zone once to attend one of Davian's parties. But it wasn't until I came here that I became bathed in the arcane.</i>

<i>With every passing day, I had to buck up and put on a good face, pretending I was unphased by what everyone else took as commonplace. At first, Trente Gagarin had seemed like any other vampire. Exceptional, yes, powerful, yes. And I had learned long ago that every vampire suffered in his or her own way. But certain qualities came up again and again. Trente avoided the sun, had strength and speed far in excess of any Mortal man - and of course, those two wicked teeth in place of the incisors. But evidence kept mounting that she was something else. Not only could she conduct rituals to move entire houses across the country, now she insisted that she could become pregnant? My own ability to walk in the daylight, once a point of pride for me, seemed wholly and utterly pedestrian.</i>

<i>I don't know how Friday got my number. She never introduced herself or made any pleasantries. She just started talking to me as if we'd always been friends.</i>

<br><i>Talking to Friday had reminded me about promises, commitments I'd made to myself. My father's orchards had meant everything to him. Sometimes I'd even thought they'd meant more to him than me and my sister. But I tried not to think too much about that.</i>

<i>When he'd died, I'd tried to take over the care of the trees. But I wasn't serious about it and the harvests suffered. Straud brought in various help, Cedric, Makoa, even Mandarc stuck his nose in from time to time but I think he was more interested in consuming the fruit rather than cultivating it. Sometimes Quarq had showed up but that had been awkward even before he started courting my sister.</i>

<i>No, truly in my heart of hearts, I felt that the taming and care of the fruit was my responsibility. It was one of my regrets in coming here - I hadn't brought any of the supplies with me. To tell the truth, I don't know that Trente would have wanted to clutter her carefully manicured lawn with plasma fruit trees, but still - I wondered if there was anything I could do to bring my dream to life.</i>

<i>Father had believed that through the fruit, it would be possible for our kind to subsist without taking from humanity, or any other animal for that matter. It was a beautiful vision. Utopia, even. I didn't want to abandon everything he had worked so hard for.</i>

<i>I did not know how to broach this topic with Trente. She had her own ideas of how to properly stave off Frenzy.</i>

<i>The Queen maintained what vampires referred to as a "herd". Her fame as a voice actress made this easy - it seemed that when people recognized her voice as something they'd heard before on their little noiseboxes, they would bend over backwards, do just about <u>anything</u> to hear her speak some more.</i>

<i>Sometimes, many times, she would go out of the house in the evenings and I would have no idea what it was that she was doing. But other times she brought the humans back for us to entertain together. It had been difficult at first, as I really had nothing in common with these people. But I worked on my schmoozing and tried to find the interests we had in common. Trente encouraged me to play games, watch television, listen to music, all so I'd have something to fuel small talk. It was a far cry from how I'd been brought up.</i>

<i>Trente had the magnificent ability to work a room. She could tell a story about the most banal happening and she would have them crowded around her, eager for more. She would answer their silly questions, embellishing her stories with detail and nuance to make the commonplace into something fantastic. And then, without fail, she'd deliver some witticism as her punchline and leave them all in stitches. Her confidence was infectious, but I kept it at arm's length, not daring to touch that which was so completely hers. I just smiled and went along for the ride. That was, of course, until I realized something.</i>

<i>She was training me.</i>

<br><i>The house was always quiet at this hour of the night. Though I very much enjoyed the sunlight - working in the garden brought me great peace - I had also come to relish this time of the day. No stampeding footsteps upon the staircase, no televisions blaring, no incomprehensible incantations... But I would not be permitted to savor the silence, for tonight, my Queen and I would be playing host and hostess.</i>

<i>I had just finished arranging crackers upon a tray when I feel Trente summon me to the door.</i>

<i>I did not always understand the etiquette of telepathic communication, but thankfully, my mistress was patient.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB!
> 
> HELLO--
> 
> WE'RE HERE. 
> 
> FINALLY.
> 
> TRAFFIC WAS A BITCH.

<br><i>I hold the door open. The wind is vicious and unforgiving. I am surprised - there is but one guest clinging close to the Queen's shadow.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I'M SORRY WE'RE LATE.
>
> LILY, THIS IS CALEB.
> 
> CALEB, LILITH. 
> 
> LILITH PLEASANT.

<br><i>My focus wavers. But still, I smile.</i>

#### CALEB

> NICE TO MEET YOU, LILITH.
> 
> COME ON IN, IT'S COLD OUT HERE.

<br><i>We gladly enter the foyer and the women remove their shoes and coats. As if addressing my confusion, the voice of my Queen reverberates in my mind.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> (SORRY I DIDN'T BRING ALL OF THEM.)
> 
> (THE OTHERS CUT OUT EARLY.)
> 
> (BUT LILITH IS NICE.)
> 
> (YOU'LL LIKE HER.)

<br><i>I still really wasn't sure how telepathy with her worked. Could she read anything I thought, or only the words I intended? Could she sense even what I tried to keep private? I spoke, rather than dwell in the anxiety of what she could and couldn't see.</i>

#### CALEB

> SO, LILITH.
> 
> DO YOU LIVE IN THE CITY?

#### LILITH

> YEAH, I DO. 
> 
> I LIVE WITH MY SISTER IN MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS.

<br><i>I had to search my memories for that one.</i>

#### CALEB 

> IS THAT...
> 
> THE BRONX?

#### LILITH

> NO, MANHATTAN.
> 
> BETWEEN THE UPPER WEST SIDE AND HARLEM. 
> 
> AROUND THE UNIVERSITY.

#### CALEB

> VERY NICE.
> 
> ARE YOU A STUDENT THERE?

<br><i>She scoffs.</i>

#### LILITH

> ME?
> 
> HA, NOPE. 
> 
> MY SISTER IS A POST-DOC THERE.
> 
> I JUST HELP PAY THE RENT.

#### CALEB

> HEY, IT WORKS.

<br><i>The Queen, having now donned her house slippers, takes over the conversation.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB--
>
> I'M GOING TO SHOW LILY UP TO THE SITTING ROOM UPSTAIRS.
> 
> CAN YOU GRAB THE SNACKS AND MEET US UP THERE?
> 
> WHAT DO YOU DRINK, LILY?

#### LILITH

> OH, ANYTHING, DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
> 
> WINE?

<br><i>Trente smiles.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> WE HAVE PLENTY.
> 
> WE ARE A WINE HOUSE.

<br><i>They disappear upstairs and I am alone for a moment. But I know I cannot linger too long in the quiet. The Queen had a certain rhythm, a cadence she liked to maintain at her gatherings. If her guests had to wait for food, that just would not do. No, not at all.</i>

<i>The wind howled at the windows, rattling them in their frames. I looked at the cheese plate, which I had set to warm to room temperature underneath a dome of glass. I remove the cover and look at the food. It doesn't smell like much, and for that I am grateful. But the cheese has a dull sheen that reminds me of plastic. I dump a few more crackers on the plate and ascend the stairs.</i>

<i>When I get there, Trente and her guest have already opened another bottle of wine.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB!
> 
> I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND US STARTING WITHOUT YOU--
> 
> APPARENTLY WE ALREADY HAD A BOTTLE UP HERE.

#### CALEB

> THAT'S FINE.
> 
> NO WORRIES.

<br><i>A blush has already spread over Lilith's face. That was fast.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> LILY WAS JUST TELLING ME ABOUT THE LAST MOVIE SHE SAW IN THE THEATERS.

<br><i>She turned to face her friend, away from me.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT AGAIN?

<br><i>But we had to wait for Lilith to finish her faceful of wine. She swallows indelicately.</i>

#### LILITH 

> OH--
> 
> YEAH--
> 
> I WENT TO GO SEE NOSFERATU.

<br><i>The Queen looked back at me with those blue eyes.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> IT SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD.
>
> MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE IT.

<br><i>I gathered my focus. But I was off-center.</i>

#### LILITH

> THERE HAVE BEEN MANY VERSIONS OF IT MADE, BUT THIS IS THE NEWEST ONE.

#### TRENTE 

> I SUPPOSE THE ORIGINAL MUST BE NEARING...
> 
> A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AT THIS POINT.

#### LILITH

> SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

<br><i>She took another sizable swig of wine.</i>

#### LILITH

> THE FIRST ONE IS A SILENT MOVIE.

<br><i>They were sitting on the floor, cross-legged. I did not want to join them on the carpet, but I had no choice.</i>

#### LILITH

> THE...
>
> CINEMATOGRAPHY WAS GREAT THOUGH.
> 
> IT WASN'T IN BLACK AND WHITE--
> 
> I SUPPOSE THAT WOULDN'T GO OVER WELL WITH AUDIENCES--
> 
> BUT CERTAIN SCENES SEEMED TO HEARKEN BACK TO THAT LEGACY.

#### TRENTE 

> I'VE SEEN THE ONE THEY PUT OUT IN THE SEVENTIES, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY CAPTURE MY INTEREST.
> 
> IT WAS...
> 
> TOO LONG.

<br><i>The Queen raises her glass, but does not drink.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I PROPOSE A TOAST, NOW THAT CALEB IS HERE.
> 
> CALEB, LET ME...
> 
> POUR YOU A GLASS.

<br><i>She takes a glass from her side and attaches a small charm to its foot. She often used these so that we wouldn't confuse whose was whose.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> A TOAST!
> 
> ...
> 
> TO--
> 
> ...
> 
> LILY, WHAT SHALL WE RAISE IT TO?

<br><i>The young woman thought for a moment, biting her lip and making a childish expression with her eyes.</i>

#### LILITH

> TO FRIENDSHIP, AND LOVE--
> 
> AND THE DANGEROUS POWER...
> 
> OF OBSESSION.

<br><i>We clinked our glasses together.</i>

#### TRENTE

> OBSESSION?

<br><i>Lilith looked to the side, feeling sheepish.</i>

#### LILITH

> HEH...
> 
> YEAH, I GUESS I HAVE THE MOVIE ON MY MIND.

<br><i>This could not have pleased Trente more. She smiled.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T SEEN IT!
> 
> ...
> 
> TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT.

<br><i>Lilith's hands went to her hair and she toyed with a chunk of her orange strands.</i>

#### LILITH

> WELL, THE GUY WHO PLAYED THE COUNT WAS...
>
> PRETTY GOOD.
> 
> THOUGH...
> 
> I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING MOST OF THE TIME.

<br><i>Trente smirked.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> ADDS TO THE MYSTIQUE.

#### LILITH

> AND THEY GAVE HIM THIS...
> 
> I DON'T KNOW--
> 
> RASPY BREATH.
> 
> THAT SEEMED A BIT ODD TO ME.
> 
> I GUESS I JUST WASN'T USED TO IT, COMING FROM THE OLD VERSION, BUT I DON'T KNOW, ISN'T HE...
> 
> UNDEAD?
> 
> WHY WOULD HE NEED TO BREATHE?

<br><i>There is an awkward silence. I say something.</i>

#### CALEB

> HE...
> 
> STILL NEEDS AIR.
> 
> TO SPEAK.

<br><i>The Queen pretends to drink the wine.</i>

#### LILITH 

> OH.
> 
> HUH.
> 
> I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE. 
> 
> I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

<br><i>Lilith continues to imbibe. I... am not in the mood.</i>

#### LILITH 

> THE SIDE ACTORS WERE ALRIGHT, I GUESS.
> 
> I HAD NO COMPLAINTS.
>
> THE DOCTOR WAS SOMEONE FAMOUS; I RECOGNIZED HIS FACE BUT I COULDN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME.

#### TRENTE 

> VAN HELSING?

<br><i>Lilith swallows.</i>

#### LILITH

> NO NO NO.
>
> HE HAS SOME GERMAN NAME IN THIS ONE, BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER.
> 
> BUT HIS REAL NAME.
> 
> I JUST...
> 
> CAN'T REMEMBER.

#### CALEB

> I'M SURE IT'S JUST THE WINE.

<br><i>She hasn't touched the food.</i>

#### LILITH

> THERE WERE A FEW REALLY GOOD CALLBACKS.

#### TRENTE 

> THE WHOLE FILM...
> 
> IS AN HOMAGE.

#### LILITH

> I LIKED WHAT THEY DID WITH THE SHADOWS...
> 
> HIS HANDS STRETCHING OVER THE TOWN...
> 
> AND THEN LATER, THEY DID THE SCENE WITH HIM ASCENDING THE STAIRS...

#### TRENTE 

> CLASSIC.

#### LILITH

> THE WHOLE THING WAS PRETTY GOOD, SOME DEFINITE CHANGES FROM THE SOURCE, BUT NOTHING REALLY STOOD AS A BIG DEPARTURE FROM THE FIRST ONE.

#### TRENTE 

> IT IS ALWAYS SO SAD TO ME WHEN MODERN FILMMAKERS ABANDON THE ORIGINAL VISION.

#### LILITH

> I...
> 
> TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU.

<br><i>She belched, and tried to hide it, but the little smell wafts toward me.</i>

#### LILITH

> I GUESS THE ONLY WEIRD THING WAS...
> 
> WELL--
> 
> THERE WAS--
> 
> SEX IN THIS ONE.
> 
> I GUESS THE 1922 MIGHT HAVE HAD THOSE OVERTONES, HELL, MAYBE THAT'S PART OF THE REASON IT WAS BANNED.
> 
> I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT, AND IT DIDN'T REALLY DETRACT FROM THE RETELLING, BUT...
> 
> IT WAS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
> 
> I SUPPOSE THAT IS PART OF THE POINT OF HORROR--
> 
> IT TRIES TO MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.
> 
> LEAVE YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

<br><i>We let the girl speak.</i>

#### LILITH

> BUT, FOR A VAMPIRE MOVIE, AT LEAST IT WASN'T TOO GOREY.
> 
> AND NOT TOO MANY JUMP SCARES EITHER.
> 
> I APPRECIATED THAT.

<br><i>Trente let out a little puff of air.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF A MOVIE.

<br><i>Lilith finished her glass of wine.</i>

#### LILITH

> I SUPPOSE NOT.

<br><i>She looked a little light-headed. She seemed to be having trouble keeping her eyes steady. And every so often, she swayed back and forth. I don't think sitting on the floor was doing her any favors.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> DARLING, YOU LOOK A LITTLE TIRED.
> 
> HERE, HAVE A BIT TO EAT.
> 
> YOU CAN LAY DOWN IF YOU'D LIKE.

<br><i>She raises her hand to shoo away the offering.</i>

#### LILITH

> OH...
> 
> NO--
> 
> I'M OKAY.

<br><i>But the Queen won't take "no" for an answer.</i>

#### TRENTE

> LILY.
> 
> I INSIST.

<br><i>Her eyes flutter as her consciousness threatens to fade. Trente turns to me.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> CALEB. 
> 
> WHY DON'T YOU GET ONE OF THE BLANKETS FOR OUR GUEST?
> 
> THAT MAY MAKE HER MORE COMFORTABLE.

<br><i>I did as I was told. Trente helped Lilith to the couch. She had difficulty getting to her feet, but my Queen was anything but intoxicated.</i>

<i>The redhead gratefully accepted a pillow and placed it underneath her head. I spread the blanket over her.</i>

<i>I stood there with my Queen. I sensed her gaze upon me and I granted her my eyes.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> PEACEFUL, ISN'T SHE?

<br><i>I looked back at Lilith. I said nothing.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.
>
> THE INNOCENT SLEEP AT NIGHT.

<br><i>My hands felt idle.</i>

#### CALEB

> I SUPPOSE SO.

<br><i>I thought I heard a car rush by outside but in an instant, the room is again silent.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> TAKE HER.
>
> I BROUGHT HER FOR YOU.

<br><i>Lilith's breathing is unsteady and irregular. She sputters in her sleep. I keep watching her.</i>

#### CALEB

> I THOUGHT SHE WAS FOR YOU.

#### TRENTE 

> NO, CALEB.

<br><i>The girl seemed very tiny, curled up on the sofa.</i>

#### CALEB

> DOESN'T SHE NEED HER BLOOD?
> 
> ... TO RECOVER?

<br><i>Trente had no patience for my protestations, but she remained restrained.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> SHE WILL BE FINE.
> 
> SHE WILL WAKE IN THE LATE MORNING FROM A DREAMLESS SLEEP.
> 
> SHE WILL FEEL REFRESHED AS IF HER SLUMBER HAD BEEN DEEP AND DESERVED.
> 
> I WILL NOT BE HERE AT THAT TIME, BUT YOU WILL ENTERTAIN HER.
> 
> YOU WILL MAKE SURE SHE HAS A HEARTY BREAKFAST.

<br><i>I knew how this would go. After I drank from her, I would return to the darkness for several hours, waiting for the taste on my tongue to fade. I would wait until I again felt normal.</i>

<i>I looked at my Queen, wishing that it did not have to be this way. I thought of the fruit. Her eyes soften with a tender expression.</i>

#### TRENTE 

> YOU NEED THE XP.
