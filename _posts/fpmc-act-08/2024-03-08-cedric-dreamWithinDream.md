*****
<br><i>I dared not speak of what I had seen at the Marscapone's. For weeks I avoided everyone and everything. I couldn't explain it. But in time, it came to me.</i>

<i>It was the Dream.</i>

<i>That was the only way, I figured, I could have seen the man I did that night.</i>

<i>What had Vlad done? He had to have done something. I just didn't know what.</i>

<i>I finally figured it was time to stop avoiding the things that frightened me. I went to Straud Manor. </i>

<i>But it wasn't Straud who answered the door, it was the newcomer, Jia.</i>

<i>I stumbled. I had nearly forgot she was here, much less staying at Straud Mansion.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> HUA JIA, 您好.

<br><i>She smiled and shook her hand, disarming me.

#### HUA JIA 

> OH NO, NO PLEASE. NONE OF THAT SORT OF FORMALITY. 我們是朋友. 你說漢語嗎?

#### CEDRIC 

> 一點兒.

<br><i>She smiled again.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> OH, IT IS GOOD TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF MY FOREBEARS.
> 
> PERHAPS I WILL TEACH YOU. I EXPECT TO BE HERE A LONG TIME.

<br><i>She stepped inside the door and I followed her.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> STRAUD ISN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME?

<br><i>I realized it was a stupid thing to say as soon as it had escaped my mouth. No, things had changed. It was a mystery how Trelaine had got her so far, certainly we would not be making the return voyage.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> NO, IT SEEMS MY HELP IS NEEDED HERE.
> 
> I ONLY HOPE I AM ABLE TO REPAY MY DEBT. 
> 
> THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME THAT NIGHT.

<br><i>It occurred to me that she had been here for over a year. I had been so absorbed in my studies, that night with Lila, Mandarc, and Áine seemed like eons ago. So much had changed. We had all felt on top of the world, and then the mages had gone missing. Life had become quiet again.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> PERHAPS WHEN YOU SEE LILA AGAIN, YOU'D PASS ON A MESSAGE FOR ME?

#### CEDRIC 

> WELL, THE TRUTH IS THAT LILA AND HER MASTER HAVE VANISHED. 
> 
> WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN, WELL, IT MUST BE NEARLY A YEAR.

#### HUA JIA 

> A YEAR? 
> 
> OH MY. 
> 
> WELL, MAGES ARE KNOWN TO BEHAVE IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.
> 
> I HOPE WE WILL SEE THEM AGAIN SOON.

#### CEDRIC 

> ME TOO.

<br><i>A wistful silence filled the space between.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO SEE ME.
> 
> BUT I DON'T THINK MR. STRAUD IS HERE.

<br><i>There was an awkward pause that must have revealed my disappointment, for she changed the subject.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> DO YOU HAVE A NAME IN 漢語, CEDRIC?

#### CEDRIC 

> A NAME TO USE IN THE MIDDLE KINGDOM?
> 
> NO, I DON'T.

#### HUA JIA 

> YOU AREN'T FROM HERE, ARE YOU?

#### CEDRIC 

> I'M NOT.

#### HUA JIA 

> I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE.
> 
> YOU DO NOT SPEAK LIKE THE OTHERS DO.
> 
> IT IS LIKE HOW YOU MIGHT IDENTIFY A BEIJINGER BY WAY OF HIS "兒話". 
> 
> NEW YORKERS HAVE A WAY OF SPEAKING THAT IDENTIFIES THEM. 
> 
> YOU DO NOT HAVE IT.

#### CEDRIC 

> YOU LEARN QUICKLY.

#### HUA JIA 

> WELL, I KNEW A FEW THINGS BEFORE I CAME HERE.
> 
> YOU MUST COME FROM THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY?

#### CEDRIC 

> THEREABOUTS.

<br><i>At this, Jia rose her hand, extending a single finger, and began to scribe upon the air. In her finger's wake, red lines were left, shimmering as they stood in the air. Two 漢字 hovered in the air between the pair.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> 西追.

<br><i>She pointed to the first character.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> THIS ONE MEANS "WEST". 
> 
> IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHERE WE CAME FROM.
> 
> BUT ALL THINGS ARE RELATIVE TO WHERE WE ARE NOW, OR WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES.

<br><i>I tried to appear stoic toward her display of blood magic.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'RE AN ADEPT OF CHIMERSTRY?

<br><i>She smiled.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT IN THE COMMON TONGUE? 
> 
> I HAD ONLY EVER SEEN IT WRITTEN.

#### CEDRIC 

> IT'S A FEAT I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN WORKED A HANDFUL OF TIMES.
> 
> COLOR ME HUMBLED.

#### HUA JIA 

> YOU HONOR ME. 
> 
> PLEASE DO NOT BELITTLE YOURSELF SO.
> 
> YOUR FACILITY AT THE CATHEDRAL WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE.

#### CEDRIC 

> WHEN THERE IS A NEED, I'LL BE THERE.

<br><i>Our conversation is interrupted by the front doors slamming open as if blown by a swift wind. In walks Vladislaus Straud, followed by Mandarc. It is difficult to focus on the old man as he exudes an aura of anger. Tamed anger, but anger nonetheless. Mandarc seems to cower and scuttle behind.</i>

<i>He walks between Hua Jia and myself, causing us to step back in deference. In a moment, he's disappeared into the house, and the two of us are joined by Mandarc, now released from his duties.</i>

<i>I'm about to open my mouth to speak when Mandarc perks up as if recalling a forgotten memory, turns around, and shuts the entrance door quietly.</i>

<i>A haunting tune begins to echo through the mansion. Straud is in the basement crypt, plunking away at the pipe organ located therein. Insofar as is possible, they are alone in the entry.</i>

<i>They are listening to the music in reverence when Mandarc breaks the silence.</i>

#### MANDARC 

> THE PLAYWRIGHT HAS REDACTED HIS PROMISE TO HAVE THE PLAY DONE FOR THE BEGINNING OF SPRING.

#### CEDRIC 

> WHAT IS IT JUST GOING TO BE LATE, OR--

#### MANDARC 

> IT'S NOT COMING AT ALL.
> 
> HE'S QUIT WRITING ENTIRELY.
> 
> OR AT LEAST QUIT WRITING FOR US.

#### CEDRIC 

> WOW. 
> 
> THAT'S A SETBACK.

#### MANDARC 

> YEAH, IT IS.
> 
> THE MASTER IS PRETTY TICKED OFF.
> 
> BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE IT.
> 
> WE'VE JUST BEEN ATTRACTING A HUGE AUDIENCE WITH OUR PLAYS.
> 
> THIS MEANS WE'LL HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

#### CEDRIC 

> I WOULD THINK THAT WOULDN'T BE SO DIFFICULT...

#### MANDARC 

> OH, BUT HE'S VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT HE PUTS ON STAGE. 
> 
> FEELS IT'S AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTROL WHAT MESSAGES WE LEND OUR STAGE TO.
> 
> HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT SPONSORING THE WRONG WORLD VIEW, YOU KNOW?

#### CEDRIC 

> FAIR ENOUGH. 

<br><i>The three look at each other as Straud's music grows in intensity.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A WRITING CLASS AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

#### MANDARC 

> OH, THAT REMINDS ME. 
> 
> KEVIN DROPPED OUT OF THAT VENTURE.

<br><i>I paused a moment.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> YOU SEEN KEV LATELY?

#### MANDARC 

> NO, I HAVEN'T, WHY?

#### CEDRIC 

> OH...

<br><i>There wasn't any point to bringing this up with Mandarc.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> NOTHING.
> 
> YOU STILL THINK NIGHT SCHOOL IS GOING TO HELP YOU TAKE OVER THE WORLD?

<br><i>Mandarc crossed his arms and took on a defensive stance.</i>

#### MANDARC 

> WELL, WISE-ASS, NOT ALL OF US WERE GIFTED WITH A MAGICADEMY EDUCATION.

#### CEDRIC 

> FAT LOT OF GOOD IT'S DONE ME, I STILL CAN'T TOUCH THE ELEMENTS.

#### MANDARC 

> WHAT ABOUT YOU, JIA?
> 
> WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

<br><i>She hesitated a moment. We had touched on a sensitive topic.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> IN MY DAY, DAUGHTERS DID NOT RECEIVE FORMAL EDUCATION. 
> 
> MY MOTHER AND FATHER ALLOWED ME TO SIT IN ON MY BROTHER'S LESSONS FROM TIME TO TIME, AND I LEARNED MANY THINGS, BUT I NEVER ATTENDED SCHOOL AS SUCH.
> 
> IT WAS NOT SEEN AS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG GIRLS TO SPEND THEIR TIME SO.

#### MANDARC 

> WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!

#### CEDRIC 

> MANDARC!!

<br><i>I raised my hand to silence him. It was not his place to judge other cultures. Besides which, I still had no idea how old Hua Jia was. It was rude to even think of asking.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> OH, IT'S ALRIGHT. 
> 
> I THOUGHT THE SAME THING WHEN I WAS A GIRL TOO, AND WAS SURE I LET MY FATHER KNOW MY OPINION.
> 
> I HELPED MY BROTHER STUDY FOR HIS EXAMS AND THEREBY LEARNED MUCH OF THE FOUR BOOKS & FIVE CLASSICS.

#### MANDARC 

> THE IMPERIAL EXAMINATION WAS A CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION IN THE MIDDLE KINGDOM. 
> 
> THE PRACTICE OF SELECTING BUREAUCRATS BY MERIT RATHER THAN BIRTH STARTED EARLY IN CHINESE HISTORY, BUT THE FORMALIZED WRITTEN EXAM WAS FIRST ADMINISTERED DURING THE SUI DYNASTY OF 581-618--

#### CEDRIC 

> BEEN LOOKING OVER THE HISTORY ARCHIVES?

#### MANDARC 

> IT'S INTERESTING! 
> 
> MY MEMORY IS GETTING BETTER. 
> 
> THE IMPERIAL EXAMINATION LASTED UNTIL THE LATE QING DYNASTY, ABOLISHED IN 1905.

<br><i>It did not do much to narrow down ranges of how old Hua Jia was.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO HELP YOUR BROTHER PASS HIS EXAMS ALTHOUGH YOU COULD NEVER HOPE TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE.

<br><i>She smiled.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> OH 西追, YOU ARE TOO KIND. 
> 
> IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO SO I DO NOT THINK OF IT OFTEN.
> 
> I WOULD HAVE BEEN ILL-SUITED TO SUCH A CAREER.
> 
> THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT'S TRUE OF ALL WOMEN, THOUGH.
> 
> THE PASSAGE OF SPRING BRINGS NEW LIFE TO THE WORLD.
> 
> CERTAINLY THE CONDITION OF ALL WILL BE IMPROVED AS WE ELIMINATE INIQUITY.
> 
> IT IS HARD FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN MANY SEASONS TO RECALL WHAT IT WAS TO NOT KNOW, BUT WITH PATIENCE, THESE WILL BECOME OLD THINGS TOO.

#### MANDARC 

> PERHAPS YOU COULD WRITE FOR STRAUD'S STAGE.

<br><i>Oh, Mandarc.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> WRITE FOR THE STAGE? 
> 
> I'M NOT SURE I'M WELL-ENOUGH VERSED IN THE COMMON TONGUE.

#### MANDARC 

> OF COURSE YOU ARE!
> 
> YOU SPEAK WAY BETTER THAN THE SCHLOCK WE HAVE GOING UP THERE!

<br><i>The music we had barely been noticing stopped and in a quick second, the smell of pitch filled the air. Straud stood before us.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> SCHLOCK, EH? 
> 
> IS THAT WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT I'VE SHOWCASED?

<br><i>Mandarc tried to retreat.</i>

#### MANDARC 

> OH, NO, MASTER!
> 
> I WAS MERELY BEING INFLAMMATORY SO AS TO GIVE JIA A COMPLIMENT.

<br><i>Straud raised one, fine eyebrow.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> YES, OF COURSE.

<br><i>The old man turned around to face Hua Jia and gave her a small, but sincere, bow.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> MR. STRAUD HAS BEEN TUTORING ME IN MODERN, LOCAL SPEECH. 
> 
> I AM FINDING THE TEXTS I HAD BEEN USNG A FAIR BIT OUT-OF-DATE.
> 
> PERHAPS I WILL THINK OF WRITING SOMETHING IN GRATITUDE.

#### STRAUD 

> WE WOULD BE HONORED TO SHOW ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO WRITE FOR US.

#### HUA JIA 

> I WILL TRY NOT TO WRITE, HOW DO YOU SAY IT, "SCHLOCK".

#### STRAUD 

> YES, YOU HAVE IT. 
> 
> IT MEANS "TRASH", "GARBAGE", "JUNK".

<br><i>The final word he delivered with searing judgement toward Mandarc. But something suggested he did not mean it so fiercely.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> A GOOD CRITIC CAN FIND FLAWS IN HIS OWN WORK BUT IS ALSO QUICK TO DEFEND IT.
> 
> OTHERWISE, WHAT GOOD IS HIS BITE?

#### MANDARC 

> I AM SORRY, MASTER.

#### STRAUD 

> YOU ARE FORGIVEN, MANDARC.
> 
> BUT YOU SHOULD AVOID BEING SO CARELESS WITH YOUR SPEECH.

#### HUA JIA 

> 還行吧? 還可以?

#### STRAUD 

> IT'S LESS COMMONLY--

#### HUA JIA 

> 馬馬虎虎.

#### STRAUD 

> AH, YES. 
>
> 馬馬虎虎. 
> 
> HORSE HORSE TIGER TIGER. 
> 
> THE TALE OF THE LACKADAISICAL PAINTER FROM THE SONG DYNASTY.
> 
> PERHAPS THE PAINTER WAS SIMPLY AHEAD OF HIS TIME...

#### CEDRIC 

> WHAT'S THIS?

#### HUA JIA 

> A 成語. 
> 
> IT'S A FOUR CHARACTER EXPRESSION FROM THE MIDDLE KINGDOM. 
> 
> LIKE YOUR IDIOMS, OUR 成語 ARE ALLUSIONS OR QUOTATIONS OF LITERARY TEXTS THAT HAVE A SET MEANING.

#### CEDRIC 

> ET TU, BRUTE?

#### HUA JIA 

> PARDON ME?

#### STRAUD 

> PRECISELY.

#### MANDARC 

> "ET TU, BRUTE?" 
> 
> ACT 3 SCENE 1 OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY JULIUS CAESAR. 
> 
> MEANT TO EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE UNEXPECTED BETRAYAL OF A FRIEND.

#### HUA JIA 

> AH YES, THAT ONE IS MUCH LIKE OUR OWN 成語.

#### STRAUD 

> TRULY A LOST ART, LATIN.

#### CEDRIC 

> WITH THE SLOW DEATH OF THE CHURCH, IT'S GOT NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO THESE DAYS.

#### STRAUD 

> THE MORTAL YOUTH STILL HOLD IT ALOFT IN THE IVORY TOWERS BUT THEIR WORDS CARRY LITTLE WEIGHT.
> 
> THE OLD WISDOMS ARE SUFFOCATING BUT NONE ARE PREPARED TO REPLACE THEM.
> 
> AT ANY RATE, TO WHAT DO WE OWE YOUR VISIT, CEDRIC?
> 
> SURELY YOU DID NOT COME HERE TO PLAY WORD GAMES AND DISCUSS ETYMOLOGIES.

<br><i>I was surprised--surely he knew the purpose of my visit but I had not been prepared to discuss it in front of the others.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> WELL, I DID AS YOU ASKED AND WENT TO PAY A VISIT TO THE MARSCAPONES.

#### STRAUD 

> YES, THAT WAS SOME TIME AGO. 
> 
> I AM SORRY I HAVE NOT MADE IT INTO ASTORIA FOR SOME TIME.

<br><i>I felt my hand quiver in anxiety. He was always so calm, so collected, it was difficult to fathom trying to express my state.

#### CEDRIC 

> I SAW SOMETHING I CAN BARELY EXPLAIN, BUT...

<br><i>I stood up tall and forced the tremor from my hand.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> IT MUST HAVE BEEN DREAM, CERTAINLY DREAM, AS A RESULT OF THE MIRACLE YOU INVOKED.

<br><i>It occurred to me that this may not have been common knowledge, but I held fast to my convictions.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE?

<br><i>Mandarc and Hua Jia were staring directly at me.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> I SAW, FIRST, MYRTLE'S GREY HAIR. 
> 
> IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT WAY, NOT SINCE DAVIAN BROUGHT HER BACK.
> 
> NO, IT WAS DEFINITELY GREY, AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN I MET HER.
> 
> AND THEN SHE SUMMONED KEVIN, AND EVERY AURA OFF HIM RADIATED... NOT MAGIC, BUT...

<br><i>I was sure of what I had seen, so why couldn't I speak the word?</i>

#### STRAUD 

> VAMPIRE.

<br><i>Tension, and then, conclusion.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> YES, VAMPIRE.

#### STRAUD 

> AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN YOU MET HIM.

#### CEDRIC 

> I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT IT, IN RETROSPECT, MUST HAVE BEEN DREAM.
> 
> HE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING CURIOUS ABOUT ME, SO I DOUBT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO THE PAST.

<br><i>I sensed a sort of psychic twinkling, a telepathic message from Mandarc to Hua Jia. Probably delivering some sort of clarification.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> HE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE THAT I WASN'T A MAGE.

#### STRAUD 

> NOR SHOULD HE.

<br><i>Straud turned around and faced his enormous bookshelf, heavy with ancient tomes.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THE DREAM IS BEHAVING IN STRANGE WAYS AND I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE IT IS MY DOING.
> 
> I ASKED AND I RECEIVED. 
> 
> BUT I CANNOT SEE INTO DREAM AS I USED TO. 
> 
> IT IS AN ANCIENT DOMAIN, BUT I FACE IT WITH TOO MANY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS.
> 
> IT WILL TAKE WORK FOR ME TO GLEAN ITS WISDOMS AGAIN, WORK THAT I AM WILLING TO DO, BUT WORK THAT WILL TAKE TIME.

#### HUA JIA 

> IS THIS... 夢幻世界?

#### STRAUD 

> YES, INDEED.
> 
> YOU'VE SEEN IT, AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEE IT. 
> 
> YOU HAVE A GIFT, LIKE CEDRIC.

<br><i>I looked at her, and she looked at me, dark eyes seeming endless.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> MANDARC, YOU TOO HAVE A GIFT, BUT IT IS FIRMLY PLANTED IN THE REALM OF THE LIVING, AND THERE YOU MUST FOCUS YOUR EFFORTS.
> 
> YOU HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO DO THIS, AND FOR YOUR DILIGENCE, I APPLAUD YOU.

#### MANDARC 

> THANK YOU, MASTER.

<br><i>There was a pause in the conversation, and I noticed the wind beating against the outside of the house. The weather was changing.</i>

<i>Hua Jia broke the ice.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> 大師, PLEASE DO NOT BE UPSET ABOUT YOUR PLAYWRIGHT. 
> 
> REMEMBER THE OLD MAN AT THE BORDER.

#### STRAUD 

> 塞翁失馬，焉知非福.

#### MANDARC 

> (It's always fú.)

#### HUA JIA 

> 塞翁失馬，焉知非福. 
> 
> A STORY ATTRIBUTED TO 莊子 OF THE WARRING STATES PERIOD.
> 
> THE TALE TELLS OF AN OLD MAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE BORDER WITH HIS SON.
> 
> ONE DAY, HIS HORSE RAN AWAY, BOUND FOR ENEMY TERRITORY. 
> 
> HIS NEIGHBORS REMARKED ON HOW MISFORTUNATE THIS WAS.
> 
> BUT THE OLD MAN, WISE AND PATIENT, RESPONDED, "MAYBE IT'S A BLESSING."
> 
> A FEW DAYS LATER, THE HORSE RETURNED WITH MANY WILD HORSES IN TOW.
> 
> THE OLD MAN'S SON ATTEMPTED TO TAME ONE OF THE WILD HORSES. 
> 
> HE WAS THROWN FROM THE HORSE AND BROKE HIS LEG.
> 
> AGAIN THE NEIGHBORS LAMENTED, BUT THE OLD MAN REMAINED STOIC, STATING PERHAPS IT WASN'T A CALAMITY.
> 
> NOT LONG AFTER, ALL THE YOUNG MEN IN THE VILLAGE WERE CONSCRIPTED TO FIGHT, BUT THE OLD MAN'S SON WAS SPARED BECAUSE OF HIS BROKEN LEG.
> 
> IN THE END, A LOST HORSE TURNED OUT TO BE A BLESSING.
> 
> LIFE IS UNCERTAIN.
> 
> PERHAPS YOUR LOST HORSE WILL TURN OUT TO BE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE, TO USE A TURN OF PHRASE FROM YOUR TONGUE.

#### STRAUD 

> BEAUTIFULLY STATED.
