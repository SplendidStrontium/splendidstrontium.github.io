*****
<br><i>I could not leave this place. Of course, I had left. I had been forced to leave, first by the Doctor Trelaine, and then later when my father taught me the unfortunate truth of the vampiric affliction. Skittish at first, I learned more about myself and derived confidence from the things I could not leave behind. I learned how to be my own home. But even so, the Magicademy was a part of me as I was a part of it. Though I would eventually renounce much of what I thought I was, I found certain things could not be changed and would remain even as everything else gave way and crumbled before me. Straud freed me from seeking the Mortals as foodstuff, but with that liberation came chains I had long forgotten when invigorated by Blood. I remembered what it was to feel tired, ill, incapable, frail, dependent. My body became very heavy and I dragged it around with me as a ball and chain. I sank back into the habits of childhood, barely scraping through life, bound to this house, beholden to my mother, who once again found herself bringing meals to my bedside.</i>

<i>I am not so sure she wanted me to accept Straud's cure and become a mage. When my father took up my education in my adolescence, I suspected Mother was all too glad to be rid of me. Finally she was free of her sickly child and had borne an exceptional Vampire. And I <u>was</u> an exceptional Vampire. The Beast guided my hand and fang and not once did the Thirst drive me into madness. Not... true madness, anyway. It did not matter that I despised it, not to her. Life was not for enjoyment, that left you fat and weak. Life was about work and success. She had always made a point of surrounding herself with only the best, and finally I was the spitting image of my father.</i>

<i>So when I gave all that up, I suppose she was disgusted with me. She resented trying to teach me elementary charms, spells ordinarily taught alongside fractions and cursive script. I was then nearing my fortieth year, at least by Mortal reckoning, and I might as well have regressed back into diapers and velcro shoes.</i>

<i>But I did not allow her attitude to poison me against her. I had proof of her greatness and dedication all around me and I simply accepted that she could not show it to me personally. When she bickered with my father, I tried to stay out of it, recognizing that I could do nothing to change what had happened long before my birth. They seemed as business partners first and foremost. And like so many Mortal children, that suited me just fine. </i>

<i>Although my mother had placed few kisses upon my forehead, when she died at the hands of her friend Agnes Sepal, I mourned. Though I had no certainty beforehand that it could be done, I made a leap of faith. I bound her spirit to our antiquated computer system. It was not too difficult, really, as I found Mother's spirit had clung to this old house as oil to wood. My father, too, had lost his corporeal form at the hands of our family nemesis, but his soul had found refuge in my psyche. It was stranger than fiction, but I endured and even thrived.</i>

<i>I was never alone with this burden. I had what remained of my father's acolytes and Straud had pledged his coterie to support what remained of the foundling home. Of all of them, Cedric was the one who never wavered. He called my father Master and we were as brothers. He and Straud were the only ones who did not question my decision to forsake vampirism.</i>

<i>And I had now become comfortable in my skin. I was happy with who I was and excited about what the future could hold for me as I uncovered my Talent - something I had been far from promised on the eve of accepting the Cure.</i>

<i>But then, everything changed. Davian freed my mother and father from their prisons and brought them back into the realm of the living. It is something no child, Extranatural or Mortal, is ever prepared for. The pair now bustled about the house, energized by their new leases on life, and vowed to do things right this time. Where I had taken the dusty old home as my inheritance, all of a sudden I was sharing the space with my parents again, long after I'd adjusted to the quiet. I had changed, they had changed, or... well... at least they <u>seemed</u> different. They were... <u>nice</u> to each other, and at first I was set ill-at-ease to see them talk and embrace and behave as husband and wife. It took time, but eventually I came to the conclusion that this was actually a righting-of-wrongs, a final accounting, and that this was the way things were always supposed to have been.</i>

<i>Except for the house. Without the Orphans, she was still empty.</i>

*****
#### KEVIN 

> MOTHER, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

<br><i>Today, she seemed at peace. I had found her typing away at a computer, a number of tomes spread on the empty corners of the desk.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> OF COURSE, KEVIN.
> 
> I CAN TAKE A MOMENT. 
> 
> I'LL PUT SOME TEA ON.
> 
> DO YOU WANT ANY?

#### KEVIN 

> YEAH, I'LL TAKE SOME.

<br><i>We descended the stairs. It still felt strange to walk in front of her but I knew I needed to get past the discomfort. I was not a child anymore. </i>

<i>At the bottom of the stairs, we turn the corner. The kitchen was tidy but far from spotless. I had lately noticed my mother's calculations before using an incantation to banish stray crumbs. Where she once may have invoked her Talent on a whim, today sometimes I found her with a rag in hand, completing tasks in the most Ordinary fashion. But I was not about to question her methods.</i>

<i>Sitting atop the stove is a used kettle in stainless steel. It is an old friend of mine.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

#### KEVIN 

> SOMETHING CAFFEINE-FREE. 
>
> IT'S LATE.

<br><i>My mother could take in the stimulant at any hour of the day. I had not inherited that trait from her.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> THANKS FOR THE TEA, MA.
> 
> CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING?

#### MYRTLE 

> YES, KEVIN.
> 
> GO AHEAD.

<br><i>I did not like to relay this news but I felt I needed to tell her.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> DAVIAN IS...
> 
> AWAY.
> 
> HE'S LEFT THE PLANET. 
> 
> SAYS HE'S CHASING AFTER HIS WAYWARD APPRENTICE, LILA.
> 
> HE PLANS TO RETURN, OF COURSE, BUT FOR NOW, HE'S NOT HERE.

<br><i>Though Davian was quite a bit older than my mother, he allowed her to dote on him like a second son. They had a certain affection for each other, perhaps, I assumed, because they both belonged to a more civilized age.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

<br><i>We sit there in silence for a moment. All of a sudden, the tea erupts into song, entirely too early.</i>

<i>Without a word, my mother turns around to turn off the heat. Her hand is quivering.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

<br><i>She tries to mask her emotion. But her voice is quiet and she doesn't turn to face me.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> W-WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EARTH?
> 
> WITHOUT DAVIAN?

<br><i>I did not know what to say to her.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> WE STILL HAVE STRAUD.
> 
> DAD AND THE COTERIE.
> 
> EVEN THE ORDER...

<br><i>She slams her fist upon the counter.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> DAMN THE ORDER!

<br><i>I tried to be cautious.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN OUR FRIENDS BUT I THOUGHT DAVIAN PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR US--

#### MYRTLE 

> YEAH, WELL HE'S NOT HERE TO SIGN OUR LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION!

#### KEVIN 

> THEY MAY NOT LIKE OUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE NIGHTFOLK, BUT THEY CANNOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT WE FIGHT FOR GOOD.

#### MYRTLE 

> GOOD, SCHMOOD!
> 
> THE DAYS OF THE ORDER ARE OVER.
> 
> WITHOUT DAVIAN, WE CANNOT HOPE TO STAND AGAINST TRENTE GAGARIN.

#### KEVIN 

> STRAUD CAN--

#### MYRTLE 

> STRAUD CAN DO WHAT?
> 
> HE FIGHTS TOO MANY WARS ON TOO MANY FRONTS. 
> 
> WE ASK TOO MUCH OF ONE MAN.

#### KEVIN 

> I COULD SAY THE SAME OF DAVIAN. 
> 
> HE NEEDED TO GO AFTER HIS APPRENTICE. 
> 
> WE CANNOT ENSLAVE HIM TO FIGHT OUR WARS.

#### MYRTLE 

> DID YOU TALK TO HIM YOURSELF?

<br><i>She was flippant and indignant. This was a version of her with which I was more acquainted.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> NO.
> 
> MANDARC SPOKE TO HIM.

#### MYRTLE 

> AND MANDARC SPOKE TO YOU?

#### KEVIN 

> WELL, NO.
> 
> CEDRIC TOLD ME.

#### MYRTLE 

> AH, YES.
>
> WE'RE PLAYING THE DAMN TELEPHONE GAME.

<br><i>I could have lost my patience with her, but I held steady.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MANDARC IS LYING?

<br><i>She had spent time with Mandarc during her depression at Rindle Rose. The vampire held a special place in her heart. He was a gentle soul.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> ...
> 
> NO, I SUPPOSE NOT.

#### KEVIN 

> YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO EITHER.

<br><i>The hot water still sat in the kettle. I think we'd both lost our appetite.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MOM. 
> 
> I KNOW OUR FAMILY OWES DAVIAN A HUGE DEBT AFTER ALL HE'S GIVEN US.
>
> BUT HE DID NOT BRING YOU BACK TO LIFE TO CLING TO HIS COATTAILS. 
> 
> HE BELIEVED IN YOU AND YOUR POWER TO MAKE REAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD.
>
> YOU ARE INCREDIBLY CAPABLE AND EVERYONE SEES THAT EXCEPT YOU.

<br><i>I did not expect her to accept my compliment, but I gave it anyway. She needed to hear it.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> DAVIAN WILL RETURN AND WE WILL SHOW HIM WHAT WE'VE DONE.

<br><i>She continued to stare at the cooling kettle.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> WE COULD RESTART THE SCHOOL--

#### MYRTLE 

> I'M NOT BRINGING MORE CHILDREN INTO THIS.

<br><i>She spoke quietly, but firmly, with a resigned finality that indicated she'd already made up her mind.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> BUT WASN'T THAT THE PLAN?

<br><i>She finally turned toward me as if to magnify her conviction.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> I REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FATTENING OF PIGS FOR THE SLAUGHTER.

<br><i>I did not like where this was going.</i>

#### KEVIN

> MOTHER, THIS IS THEIR WORLD TOO. 
> 
> SHOULD WE NOT GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO FIGHT FOR IT?

<br><i>She looked away again.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> ...
> 
> WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE.

#### KEVIN 

> THAT IS INCREDIBLY SHORT-SIGHTED!
> 
> IT COULD BE LIFETIMES BEFORE WE ACHIEVE PEACE!

#### MYRTLE 

> THEN FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO RAISE THE CHILDREN.
> 
> I CAN'T DO IT.
> 
> NOT ANYMORE.

#### KEVIN 

> MOTHER, WE NEED YOU!

<br><i>I was pleading now. She was retreating, hiding again. I thought we had moved past this.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> I'M TIRED.
> 
> I'M SO DAMN TIRED.
> 
> YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR TALENT.
> 
> YOU DO IT.

#### KEVIN 

> I STRUGGLE TO DO HALF - A QUARTER - OF WHAT COMES SO EASILY TO YOU!

#### MYRTLE 

> I'M OLD.

#### KEVIN 

> YOU'RE A MAGE!
> 
> YOU COULD LIVE FOREVER IF YOU WANTED TO!

#### MYRTLE 

> I DON'T WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. 
> 
> I WANT TO FINISH WHAT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO DO AND THEN I WANT TO REST.
> 
> DESPITE MY MANY SINS, I THINK - I HOPE - I WILL HAVE EARNED THAT.

<br><i>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was as if nothing we had done over the past several years had made any difference. It was all a farce. She was just as she had been.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> AND WHAT ABOUT DAD?
> 
> DON'T YOU CARE WHAT HE THINKS?

#### MYRTLE 

> YOUR FATHER MANIFESTED LONG BEFORE I WAS BORN AND HE WILL CONTINUE ON LONG AFTER I CEASE TO EXIST.

#### KEVIN 

> HE LOVES YOU!

#### MYRTLE 

> AND HE WILL FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

#### KEVIN 

> HOW CAN YOU JUST LEAVE HIM BEHIND? 
> 
> THAT'S...

<br><i>I searched for a curse to come even close to conveying the rage brewing inside my soul.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> THAT'S INCREDIBLY SELFISH OF YOU!

<br><i>She paused for a moment, considering my outburst.</i>

#### MYRTLE 

> ...
> 
> WE ARE ALL ALLOWED A SELFISH DECISION FROM TIME TO TIME.

<br><i>Regarding the conversation over, she disappears in a wave of scintillating light, transportalating out of my sight.</i>

<i>By now, the water has returned to a lukewarm state. My mouth is dry, but I leave it sitting, abandoned, and walk out of the room.</i>

<br><i>It was over ten years ago, yes, longer than that, back when I was still a vampire, that Straud introduced us to Avaelle Easton.</i>

<i>She was in rough shape. Physically, superficially, she had wounds like none I'd ever seen on a vampire. Her skin was dark, blackened as if from a fire. One eye was swollen shut, stubbornly refusing to heal. And her hair, once a vibrant auburn hue, was haphazardly cut short against her scalp. Clothes hung off her body, barely hiding her bones and paradoxically making her seem even more naked. And yet, sustained by the mystery of the Curse, she stood straight, never-the-less too weak to kneel and beg clemency.</i>

<i>Straud asked me to help her. I had earlier taken up a half-hearted interest in robotics and cybernetics, but not with any particular goal in mind. It was a flight of fancy intended to stave off the pain of idle hands. But the Count seized upon it, insisting that I was the only one who could do this for her.</i>

<i>And he promised that he would help.</i>

*****
#### KEVIN 

> HI, CEDRIC.
> 
> NICE NIGHT WE'RE HAVING.

<br><i>I had not even needed to knock on the door. He had known of my arrival. Yes, I had a key, but I had no reason to be so rude.</i>

#### CEDRIC

<br><i>I could hear AVAEL plinking away at the piano on the second floor. There was no hiding it: this was an intervention.</i>

<br><i>Cedric did not linger too long at the Magicademy. I did not expect him to return to his post at the auxiliary apartments, no, not tonight. I knew exactly where he was going. Underneath the cover of night, he would slip effortlessly between shadows. He would wait just outside the reaches of the streetlamps, linger in the unknowable silence. He would then seize his prey precisely at the moment they thought to fear. Yes, he reveled in that arousal, just when the skeletal hand of terror choked the heart and sped the blood into the veins. I knew him. I knew where he was.</i>

<i>But tonight, I sheltered inside the same four walls I had taken refuge in since my birth. I could not follow Cedric into darkness, not here, not now, not like this. I had to guard myself. I was needed, I was necessary. I could not trust that the others would be there when I needed them, not with so many pulling away. If the pillars were crumbling, I would see myself remain to the last. For me to endure, I had to play conservatively. I would watch, wait, and when I finally got my hand, I would be ready to play.</i>

<br><i>The only one that remains in the old house is Father. I can sense him even as he tries to minimize his presence, taking a moment of reflection in his study. Though he has a sprawling complex and chapel underground, he seemed to prefer a more mundane existence. But it was all a grand masquerade - there was absolutely <u>nothing</u> Mundane about my Father.</i>

<i>I knew he was in there. I knew he knew I was here. And yet, I knocked.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> FATHER?

> COME IN, KEVIN.

<br><i>He is surrounded here by books, but every single one of them is closed. There is no computer in this room, although a cellphone lays face down on the corner of the desk. Staying connected to the wintranet for him now required conventional methods.</i>

<i>I suppose, despite it all, when I was here I again felt small. Maybe that was a comfort, that even as the coterie dissolved at the edges, I was still the son of the fabled Prince of Elysion.</i>

#### VINCENT

<br><i>The day ends much as it began: with a whimper. I am alone on the top floor of this grand old house ignomiously dubbed by some as the Magicademy. In my room are reminders of my mortal limitations: I cannot yet conjure clothes to my form nor can I rest without the plush comfort of a bed. I require absolute darkness to sleep - to say nothing of the silence.</i>

<i>I chose this existence. I was given a taste of the other side and I refused its allure. No, I wanted, craved, something else. Some, even now, resented me for refusing my birthright - yes, son of the Prince of Elysion. But what was that worth when I would have to forsake the rest of the Tellurian? Maybe I would not persist into Eternity - I had given up that promise - but if I worked hard enough - and yes, I would have to work - maybe I could leave behind something that would endure long after no one could remember my name.</i>

<i>With this vain hope in my heart, heavy with the grievances of a world in pain, I fell asleep.</i>
