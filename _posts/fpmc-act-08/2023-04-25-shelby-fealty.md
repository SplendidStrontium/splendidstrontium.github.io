*****
<BR><i>I was created with a dream in my heart. It was an aspiration born of a fable, hardly more substantial than a young girl's hope of finding "somewhere over the rainbow". But this hope consumed me and formed the center of my raison d'Ãªtre.</i>

<i>I came up with a plan. I'd solve the Strangerville mystery. But I failed. My vision of captivating the Camarilla Prince dissolved before my very eyes. I had nothing, I was nothing. But I still had my dream.</i>

<i>I crawled, belly scraping the floor, pathetic, following rumor and hearsay to Elysium. I needed help if I was to prove myself to the Prince. This place was supposed to welcome supernaturals of all kinds and provide guidance to those in need. And I was in need.</i>

<i>There was a concept I'd learned of in a book series. Something about divine luck. Something about being the star of one's own adventure and always, quite out of necessity, being in the right place at the right time. Looking back on it, this concept must have helped guide me to that place at that time. I had no other explanation for why I found him there at the Queens speakeasy.</i>

<i>I was right where I needed to be. There, sitting at a non-descript booth in the crowded theatre, was Tomas Ortega.</i>

<i>I would replay the events that transpired that evening in my mind again and again, as if trying to glean new wisdom. I had presented with weakness, but the Prince, in his infinite grace, had seen to bestow mercy upon my pitiable self.</i>

*****
### // THE BLUE VELVET //

#### SHELBY

> I'D LIKE TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE WITH THE PRINCE.

<BR><i>Standing in front of me, blocking my passage, was a severe looking female vampiress with dark hair and almond eyes. She wore a stern expression on her face. She had every intention of protecting her beloved Prince. What kind of man was he that had earned her undying loyalty?</i>

#### AIGUL

> WHO ARE YOU? WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE WITH THE CAMARILLA?

<BR><i>The question stunned me and my mind went blank. I could not start with my failures.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I'VE COME TO SWEAR FEALTY TO THE PRINCE.

<BR><i>Somewhere in the crowded audience, I heard laughter. But it did not come from the woman in front of me.</i>

#### AIGUL

> HUNDREDS OF PATHETIC EXCUSES FOR KINDRED ARRIVE AT MY PRINCE'S FEET EVERY NIGHT SEEKING HIS FAVOR.
> 
> WHAT SETS YOU APART?

<BR><i>I was short of stature, especially compared to the Amazon that stood in front of me. My curly hair was swept away from my face to reveal a youthful brightness that fed my pride. I'd been turned when I was scarcely more than a girl. There is a pause as she looks me over and I feel vulnerable as she scrutinizes my appearance.</i>

#### AIGUL

> WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

<BR><i>It wasn't my birth name, but I'd left that behind long ago.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I CALL MYSELF SHELBY, SIR.

#### AIGUL

> NO NEED FOR THE FORMALITIES. IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
> 
> WHERE DO YOU COME FROM, SHELBY?
> 
> WHO IS YOUR MASTER?

<BR><i>A lump formed in my throat and I was afraid my voice would utter a squeak.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I...
> 
> WOULD RATHER NOT SPEAK OF IT.

<BR><i>She raised a cautious eyebrow.</i>

#### SHELBY

> MY MASTER MISTREATED ME. 
> 
> I INTEND TO OVERCOME MY BLOOD BOND AND START ANEW HERE.

#### AIGUL

> IT DOES NOT BODE WELL THAT YOU HAVE ABANDONED HE WHO GAVE YOU THOSE FANGS.

<BR><i>I covertly ran over my birthright with my tongue. Her words were true.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I COULD NOT IN GOOD FAITH SUFFER INJUSTICE.

<BR><i>She smiles slightly, a little coy.</i>

#### AIGUL

> YOU ARE FORTUNATE TO FIND YOURSELF HERE TONIGHT. 
> 
> MY PRINCE IS INTERESTED IN YOUR STORY.
> 
> DO NOT HUMILIATE YOURSELF, LITTLE ONE.

<BR><i>She steps to the side.</i>

#### AIGUL

> FOLLOW ME.

<BR><i>She weaves in and out of the crowd, seeming to divide the people with her presence alone. The crowd, in my anxiety, had escaped my notice until now. It was a curious mix of both mortal and supernatural like none I'd ever seen. Was this the promise of Elysium?</i>

<i>Soon we are at a simple wooden table set into the wall, edged by a wooden barrier that formed the backing of another. The Prince is there, in the center, looking every bit worthy of his title. He wears a spotless white suit, contrasting his flawless tanned skin. His followers were a sort of living, or unliving, crown, adorning his sides, their eyes and fangs sparkling as if diamond.</i>

<i>I was a token of pewter in comparison.</i>

#### SHELBY

> PRINCE...

<BR><i>I bowed deeply, as it was the only gesture that seemed even remotely appropriate.</i>

#### TOMAS

> AIGUL TELLS ME THAT YOUR NAME IS SHELBY.

<BR><i>They had spoken no words to each other. Of course they must be capable of telepathy.</i>

#### TOMAS

> SHE ALSO TELLS ME THAT YOU'VE OVERCOME A BLOOD BOND TO APPEAR BEFORE ME TONIGHT.

<BR><i>His voice was smooth and practiced. I wondered how many moons had passed to instill upon him such calm. I could barely look into his eyes, shining with a rich brown that penetrated and destroyed my composure.</i>

#### SHELBY

> YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.

#### TOMAS

> YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE CRIME OF YOUR MASTER EGREGIOUS.

#### SHELBY

> YES, YOUR HIGHNESS, I DID. 
> 
> HE ASKED OF ME THINGS HE WAS UNWILLING TO DO HIMSELF. 
> 
> HE PUT ME IN DANGER ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.
> 
> HE DID NOT LOVE ME SO MUCH AS HE WANTED TO POSSESS ME.

#### TOMAS

> SO YOU BELIEVE A BLOOD BOND SHOULD BE FORMED ON THE BASIS OF LOVE?
> 
> I WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR WORDS, LEST YOU APPEAR BENEATH YOUR STATION.

<BR><i>I'd take the compliment.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I UNDERSTAND THAT LOVE ALONE CANNOT BE THE BASIS OF SUCH A UNION, BUT SHOULD IT NOT BE PART OF THE TOTAL EQUATION?
> 
> I BELIEVE IT IS PART OF WHAT MAKES THE KINDRED DESERVING OF ETERNAL LIFE -- OUR ENDLESS CAPACITY FOR LOVE.

#### TOMAS

> A ROMANTIC'S POINT-OF-VIEW.

#### SHELBY

> A WEAKNESS OF MINE.

#### TOMAS

> WERE YOU SHOWING LOVE WHEN YOU FLED YOUR CONDITION?

<BR><i>Now was my chance to defend myself best I could.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I HOPED I COULD INFLUENCE HIM TO CHANGE.
> 
> BUT IF I'M HONEST WITH YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS, I DO NOT CLAIM THIS WAS DONE OUT OF LOVE.
> 
> IT WAS DONE OUT OF A NEED OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

#### TOMAS

> YOU PLACED YOUR OWN DESIRES AHEAD OF THOSE OF YOUR MASTER'S?

#### SHELBY

> I DID ONLY AS I WAS TAUGHT, YOUR HIGHNESS.

#### TOMAS

> A BOLD CLAIM.

<BR><i>The statement stands alone and I feel exposed underneath the weight of his gaze.</i>

#### TOMAS

> IT WOULD SEEM YOU ARE IN NEED OF RE-EDUCATION.
> 
> BUT WHAT WORTH ARE YOU TO ME?

#### SHELBY

> I WANT TO BE HERE.

#### TOMAS

> YES, THAT MUCH SEEMS EVIDENT.
> 
> YOU HAVE OVERCOME MUCH TO FIND YOURSELF HERE. 
> 
> BUT WHO IS TO SAY YOU WON'T USE THAT STRENGTH OF SPIRIT TO BETRAY ME IF YOU FIND YOU DISAGREE WITH MY APPROACH?

#### SHELBY

> YOU ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN MY OLD MASTER.

#### TOMAS

> FLATTERY WITH NOT WORK IN MY COURT.
> 
> PRETTY WORDS AND WIDE SMILES ARE THE MORTALS' PLAYTHINGS.

#### SHELBY

> I BELIEVE THIS TO BE MY FINAL RESTING PLACE.

#### TOMAS

> YOU AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER HOPEFULS.

<BR><i>Fortune favors the bold.</i>

#### SHELBY

> BECAUSE, YOUR HIGHNESS, I'M LUCKY.

<BR><i>He laughed. A quick utterance, just a momentary "ha!" but it was enough to bolster my cause.</i>

#### TOMAS

> LUCK IS THE LESSER MAN'S ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE UNEXPLAINABLE. 
> 
> I DO NOT GAMBLE ON LUCK.

#### SHELBY

> BUT YOUR HIGHNESS!
> 
> IF YOU WERE STANDING IN MY SHOES, YOU'D SURELY FEEL DIFFERENTLY.
> 
> I HAVE BEEN ASTOUNDED THAT I WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE SLAVERY, AND MY STRING OF GOOD FORTUNE HAS INEXPLICABLY LED ME TO YOU TONIGHT.
> 
> I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WOULD FIND YOU HERE TONIGHT -- I EXPECTED TO FIND --

#### TOMAS

> THE CAITIFF OF QUEENS?
> 
> YES, I IMAGINE A FOUNDLING SUCH AS YOURSELF WOULD SEEK OUT HIS HALFWAY HOUSE.

#### SHELBY

> I WANTED HIM TO LEAD ME TO YOU AND INDEED HE HAS!

<BR><i>The Prince smirks.</i>

#### TOMAS

> SO THIS IS YOUR LUCK -- THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF BEFORE ME BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN PREPARED.

<BR><i>I swallowed the saliva pooling in my mouth.</i>

#### SHELBY

> I CAN'T SAY IT'S A PERFECT EXPLANATION, YOUR HIGHNESS.

#### TOMAS

> I'LL SAY NOT.
> 
> BUT I AM IN A GOOD HUMOR TONIGHT AND INCLINED TO OFFER MY HOSPITALITY.
> 
> YOU'VE AMUSED ME.
> 
> PROVIDED YOU ARE SPEAKING TRUTH, YOU ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUND ME HERE TONIGHT.
> 
> COME SIT WITH US AND WATCH THE SHOW. 
> 
> LET THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST SLIP INTO MEMORY AND LET ME JUDGE YOU ON WHO YOU ARE, NOT WHAT YOU WERE.

<BR><i>My heart, silent as it was, nearly lept from my chest.</i>

#### SHELBY

> OH, THANK YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS!!

<BR>

*****
<BR><i>Several months have now passed since the night I found myself in the Blue Velvet. Tomas, much to my continued surprise, took me under his wing and treated me with a genuine respect that I'd never before known.</i>

<i>Somehow it seemed to be kismet that I'd encountered him that night in the Queens speakeasy. That place would come to represent the first chance I had to do something for <u>him</u>.</i>
