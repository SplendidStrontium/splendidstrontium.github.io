<p class="ppl-sez">I had a revelation. She could have ascended to a higher level of power. Maybe she is struggling to control things of a planetary nature? And wouldn't it be like me down here struggling to comprehend the nature of water? I think it's what she always would have wanted. She would have transcended the ordinary.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I do not know. It is the very nature of faith that I fear I've invented them.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Okay, I can get that. But who are they? What do you know about them?</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">They are beings of immense power that originate in and emenate outward from stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That's pretty incredible.</p>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It is, isn't it? But at the same time, it seems entirely plausable. For what other being is as old, as storied, and immense as starstuff?</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's a hard sell. We are so tiny, we have no hope of understanding such a being.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think that's where she is. She's been chosen to ascend. Her soul has endured. She was judged worthy.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It does not have to be face-to-face. Comrades-in-arm share a shared tragedy, and you only see your fellow man through the crease of one's eye. You were in shared experience, do not decrease it so.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Because I fear filling myself with jealousy. Sebastian is a powerful vampire.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No, I don't understand it. I just wish I could know it from her perspective. I'll never be able to ask her.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Maybe you just won't want to ask her. It's in the past.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It is never enough. But don't go about thinking you needed her presence to alleviate yourself of guilt you accumulate in her absence. For that is covetousness, greed. You must be ready to give her up when it is her time.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Indeed, the advice seems contradictory. But the crux of the issue is your personal motivation. Everything we do should be out of love, not out of want or supposed need. We should not hold souls hostage because of our own shortcomings.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I do. I had hoped I could free her from what troubled her on Earth.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But how could existence be boiled down to a single affliction? Couldn't we just focus on solving that problem?</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You are right to know these miracles may take many shapes. You do not have the moderating influence of an Avatar as the Mages do. The nature of the vampire is coming to understand the loneliness.</p>

*****
<br><i>That evening, I could not tutor Cedric on the use of the Dream. Tomas Ortega had requested my presence at the Blue Velvet.</i>

<i>I needed all the help I could get in the coming campaign against my old rival. I was glad Ortega had seen reason and allied with our cause. The Sabbat was but one enemy on the horizon.</i>

<i>On the way to the Blue Velvet, Mandarc decided to engage in some unusual smalltalk.</i>

#### MANDARC 

> IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE'VE SEEN DAVIAN OUT AND ABOUT. 
> 
> SHOULD WE INVITE HIM OUT?

#### STRAUD

> I BELIEVE THE MAN IS TIGHTLY EMBROILED IN HIS STUDIES. 
> 
> HE WILL EMERGE WHEN HE IS READY.

#### MANDARC 

> SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SEEN LILA, EITHER.

#### STRAUD 

> DESPITE HER GREAT SHOW OF POWER, SHE IS HIS APPRENTICE. 
> 
> I IMAGINE SHE IS ASSISTING HIM. 
> 
> TONIGHT WE WORK ON DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ANOTHER FACTION: THE CAMARILLA.

#### MANDARC 

> YOU'D BETTER BE CAREFUL, OR HE'S GOING TO ASK YOU TO THROW YOUR LOT IN WITH HIM.

#### STRAUD 

> WE HAVE ALREADY JOINED FORCES.

#### MANDARC 

> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. 
> 
> HE'LL REQUEST YOU BECOME A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER OF THE CAMARILLA.

#### STRAUD 

> I DO NOT THINK THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM.

#### MANDARC 

> WHAT?

#### STRAUD

> I DO NOT THINK HE WILL ASK US TO JOIN THE CAMARILLA.
> 
> BY AND LARGE, WE FOLLOW THE PRECEPTS OF THE MASQUERADE, AND HE RECOGNIZES WE ARE ALREADY ALLIES IN THE WAR AGAINST THE SABBAT.

#### MANDARC 

> I JUST WORRY THAT HE WILL WANT TO EXPAND HIS DEFINITION OF "THE CITY".

#### STRAUD 

> WE WILL FIGHT THAT BATTLE IF IT COMES TO IT. 
> 
> WHAT'S MADE YOU SO SUSPICIOUS?

#### MANDARC 

> I KEEP THINKING OF THAT TREMERE, HASSAN. 
> 
> THE PRINCE IS A PRETTY FACE BUT PERHAPS HE AND THE TREMERE LIKE HIM ARE THE MORE HONEST FACE OF THE CAMARILLA.

#### STRAUD

> YOU ARE RIGHT TO SUSPECT THE TREMERE.

#### MANDARC 

> HOW CAN WE BE BOTH ON THE SIDE OF THE SALUBRI AND THE TREMERE?

#### STRAUD

> I HAVE NOT FORGED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE TREMERE SO MUCH AS I HAVE DECLARED FRIENDSHIP WITH THE PRINCE HIMSELF.

#### MANDARC 

> DOES HE UNDERSTAND THAT?

#### STRAUD

> I WILL MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND.

<br>

*****
<BR><i>When we arrive at the Blue Velvet, the sun has sunk into the western horizon. Mandarc and I walk through the front door and find the place abuzz with conversation. Mandarc skitters off to the bar.</i>

<i>A familiar voice sticks out in the crowd. It is one of my Childer, Áine, engaged in a flirtatious conversation with her chosen mate, the demon prince Gwydion. It was a match I could not have foreseen, but supported wholeheartedly.</i>

#### ÁINE 

> GRANDFATHER.

<BR><i>She spoke to me telepathically from across the room. But I could still hear the signature of her voice that reflected her uniqueness.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> CHILDE.

#### ÁINE 

> I'M GLADDENED BY YOUR PRESENCE.

#### STRAUD

> AS AM I.

<BR><i>Suddenly, a less-than-familiar voice bombards my consciousness.</i>

#### GWYDION 

> SALUTATIONS, GRANDFATHER.

<BR><i>He was nothing if not bold. I supposed he had both of his parents to blame for that.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I'M GLAD YOU BOTH ARE ENJOYING YOURSELVES BUT MANDARC AND I HAVE COME TONIGHT ON BUSINESS.

#### ÁINE 

> WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME?

#### STRAUD 

> A FOLLOW-UP WITH THE CAMARILLA PRINCE. THE FIRST OF MANY MEETINGS CEMENTING OUR FRIENDSHIP.

#### GWYDION 

> IT IS FORTUITOUS THAT HE'S ACCEPTED YOUR PLACE OF ELYSIUM.

#### STRAUD 

> IT IS A GOOD SHOW OF FAITH.

#### GWYDION 

> MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOUR SPEAKEASY IS DEVELOPING QUITE THE REPUTATION.

#### STRAUD 

> OH IS IT?

#### ÁINE 

> HUMILITY, GRANDFATHER, HUMILITY.

#### STRAUD 

> THE PRINCE MAINTAINS HIS SAFE HAVENS BUT HE MUST KNOW I DON'T PREFER TO TRAVEL.

#### GWYDION 

> MAYBE I'LL PAY HIM A VISIT ONE OF THESE DAYS.

<BR><i>I am surprised at how rapidly Gwydion has joined our cause. Perhaps he has seen a similarity between his plight and ours.</i>

<i>He and Áine share a knowing glance and I feel grateful that they've found each other. But I cannot dwell in it for long, as I feel the presence, calm and proud, of Tomas Ortega. With him is a young vampire who I do not recognize but seems to have an impression of me and my establishment.</i>

<i>Tomas and his accomplice walk up to me as I've set my eyes upon them and bid them welcome.</i>

<i>They are dressed in ordinary street clothes befitting the summer's approach. Tomas wore an outfit of mostly white, as he usually did, and his friend wore a youthful outfit with red accents, complete with beads in her hair. She struck me immediately as a kind, thoughtful vampire and I liked her even before she spoke.</i>

#### TOMAS 

> COUNT STRAUD.

<BR><i>Tomas bowed to me, and it surprised me. Áine and Gwydion seemed pleased to see them present the gesture. Finally our exchange attracted the attention of Mandarc, who made his way over to offer a greeting. It is bold of the Prince to travel without his wives, as it leaves him and his accomplice woefully outnumbered.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> TOMAS.
> 
> IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

<BR><i>Mandarc, Áine, and Gwydion offer salutations in return.

#### STRAUD 

> PLEASE, LET US SIT.

<BR><i>I direct the entourage over to my usual table, stage right of an empty platform covered by curtain.</i>

#### STRAUD 

> YOU ARE FORTUNATE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SIT THROUGH ANOTHER OF OUR PERFORMANCES.

#### TOMAS

> OH, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. 
> 
> SHELBY AND I BOTH ENJOYED LONG WINTER VERY MUCH.

#### SHELBY

> IT WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO THE BLUE VELVET, SIR.

#### STRAUD 

> I HAD SUSPECTED AS MUCH.
> 
> IT IS GOOD YOU HAVE COME TO JOIN US, MISS DAWSON.

#### TOMAS 

> SHE OVERCAME A BLOOD BOND IN ORDER TO DO SO.

#### STRAUD 

> AN IMPRESSIVE SHOW OF WILL.
> 
> MANDARC, TOO, BENT HIS WILL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PICK THE LOCK OF HIS PRISON.

<BR><i>Mandarc's eyes widened but he said nothing. He was not one to enjoy praise.</i>

#### TOMAS 

> THAT IS PART OF WHY I HAVE COME, COUNT. 
> 
> I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SHELBY TO YOU AS YOU NEED.
> 
> SHE IS EAGER TO LEARN BUT I THINK SHE WOULD LEARN BEST WITH YOUR FLEDGLINGS.
> 
> THEY ARE SIMILARLY STRONG-WILLED FOR THEIR AGE.

#### STRAUD 

> I APPRECIATE THE OFFERING.
> 
> I CAN ALWAYS USE AN ADDITIONAL FOOT-SOLDIER, ESPECIALLY IN THESE TRYING TIMES.
> 
> BUT IN REPAYMENT I MUST ASK SOMETHING OF YOU.

#### TOMAS 

> OF COURSE, COUNT.

#### STRAUD 

> THERE IS A PARTICULAR FELLOW IN YOUR SERVICE THAT I FIND RATHER UNTRUSTWORTHY.
> 
> IN ADDITION, HE POSSESSES A YOUNG WOMAN WHOM I WOULD LIKE TO SEE RESTORED TO AN ASSOCIATE OF MINE.

#### TOMAS 

> OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK?

#### STRAUD 

> THE TREMERE HASSAN TALEB.

#### TOMAS 

> AH YES.
> 
> HE SERVES UNDER KALYANI.

#### STRAUD 

> I AM SURE HE PAYS THE PROPER RESPECT TO YOU AND YOURS BUT HE HAS BEEN IN MY HOUSE CAUSING MISCHIEF AND, DARE I SAY, THREATENING THE MASQUERADE.
> 
> I HOPE THAT IS CAUSE ENOUGH TO ROUSE YOUR IRE BUT I CONSIDER MY PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS OF PRIMARY IMPORT IN THIS MATTER.

#### TOMAS 

> IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE CAME OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

#### STRAUD 

> A CONFESSION GIVEN UNDER DURESS CANNOT BE WHOLLY REGARDED AS TRUTHY.

#### TOMAS 

> I'M SORRY TO HEAR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER EMBRACE.

#### STRAUD 

> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER RETURNED TO MY PEOPLE.

#### MANDARC 

> EXCUSE MY INTERRUPTION, BUT WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

#### STRAUD 

> THE VAMPIRESS GABRIELLE ORLÉANS. 
> 
> THOUGH SHE NOW BE THE CHILDE OF HASSAN TALEB, SHE WAS ONCE A DEAR FRIEND OF DAVIAN HUGHES.

#### MANDARC

> OH MY. 
> 
> HELL HATH NO FURY...

#### STRAUD 

> DAVIAN HAS LARGELY STAYED OUT OF THE MATTER, RESIGNING HIMSELF TO THE FACT THAT SHE JOINED THE TREMERE OF HER OWN ACCORD. 
> 
> BUT I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY.
> 
> I DO NOT THINK THE TREMERE HAVE HER BEST INTERESTS AT HEART AND IT FALLS TO US TO CARE FOR THE FEW ENCHANTED THAT REMAIN.

#### ÁINE 

> I DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE TO TURN A MAGE.

#### GWYDION 

> THE TREMERE ARE CAPABLE OF SUPRISING FEATS WITH THEIR RITUALS.

#### TOMAS 

> WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE?

#### STRAUD 

> THEN BRING HER TO ME. 
> 
> LET ME AT LEAST HAVE A WORD WITH HER.
> 
> THEN WE WILL SEE WHERE HER TRUE LOYALTY MAY LIE.
