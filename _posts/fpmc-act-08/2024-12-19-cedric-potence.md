*****
<br><i>Looking back, it all felt so obvious. I raged, but more than that I felt humiliated. I had let my guard down, and for what? She'd just been biding her time, all the while planning her escape. None of it had meant anything to her. I fumed with one thought: That I should have known better.</i>

<i>When I left the Magicademy, the sun had long since set. Though its rays were no threat to me, I none-the-less felt safer here in the darkness. A chilled wind disturbs my hair, but I am otherwise unphased. I take one more glance at that creaky old house, noticing lights on in rooms that couldn't have possibly been occupied. And then, as if on cue, one goes out.</i> 

<i>I, too, step into the shadow and fade into mist.</i>

*****
<br><i>I wouldn't say I remember every one of my victims. No, far from it. How long had I been doing this? I supposed nearing twenty-seven years. Already the nights and days became months and years slipped through my fingers. No, I could not recall each of their faces but I was certain, with all of my senses, that each of them smelled different, like forests that never gave off the same scent twice.</i>

<i>In the early days, I had sometimes fed from animals. It certainly was an option - Straud bottled the stuff and sold it by the dozen. Vincent, with his effortless mastery of Protean, had shown me that blooddrinkers likewise existed in the animal kingdoms. And I had heard tale that at least one vampire, feeling so accutely the guilt of predating upon humanity, had subsisted for years entirely on the dribbles of vitae to be found in sewer rats.</i>

<i>But I could not bring myself to exist in such a fashion. Yes, I <u>had</u> fed on animals, even allowing myself to drain them in their entirety, safe in the very real fact that no Mortal would think twice about the discovery of a cat's corpse concealed underneath some leafy underbrush. It was possible to drink from these creatures, and it was easy. </i>

<i>Too easy. I quickly developed an aversion to the practice. In that act, I became consumed with self-loathing and disgust. It was there I truly became a monster.</i>

<i>So I turned my nose up and refused: And I was no worse off. In a city like this, humans seemed to outnumber the other vermin, or at least they alone could travel freely. They were there, everywhere, crawling, scrambling, proliferating - even as all I desired was solitude.</i>

<i>I had once indulged in a feeling one might call guilt. Reluctance. Shame. And sometimes it reared its ugly head and threatened to end my life then and there. I imagined that emotion, conviction - empathy - was what had led Kevin to seek a way out. He had masked it so well back then. Once I had sought to mimic the stillness of his eyes as he bared his fangs and sunk his teeth deep in the neck of the unsuspecting. He had been born into this, I mused, and I had been merely drafted.</i>

<i>Yes, it was all a fa√ßade. As he took from the others, he struggled to resist the torrent of emotion. Some of our kind are like that - even as their bodies are hardened as homunculi they merely possess, what remain of their nerves and mind are honed to perceive sensations and injuries the Mortals can only just outline in their grief, passion, and heartbreak. Many of the undead feel in their unlife all the feelings to which they were once inured, as if they had all been delayed, as if they had been waiting for the moment they could be ignored no longer.</i>

<i>But me? I was not like that. The night that I had been resurrected marked a stark transition - where as a young man I had flitted aimlessly through life, never terribly committed to anything, least of all my identity as a mage - I was instantly inducted into something larger than myself. I had a Master, I had a friend. I had been given only a moment to grieve what I had lost and I scarcely needed more than that. I gladly took up the gun.</i>

<i>Finally, surrounded by soldiers, I was never alone. My world would keep expanding, but I hope I am not being too boastful to suggest that I rose to every occasion. In our time of need, Straud became patriarch to the Marscapone family. Kevin and I endured even as the Old Man flirted with disaster, taking in Trelaine's orphans Avaelle and Mandarc, and soon after creating a number of new fledglings. I have never once lost faith in him, but that is not to imply that I always understood his decisions.</i>

<i>My world was full now, and I had a very real place in it. It is that sense of duty, of obligation, of belonging, that kept me so relentlessly inclined toward the Hunt. I could ingest the fabled fruit, and I would if it suited my fancy, but it did not slake my Thirst. Vitae alone kept me alive, filled me with the will to continue the fight. I oft supposed I was little different than an addict eagerly awaiting his next fix, but I did not dwell too long on the unsavory comparison. Yes, sometimes it all felt wrong and I did not like myself, the way most humans avoid opening the doors of the slaughterhouse. But I sustained myself on the assertion that this was all part of the Cycle. I had a job to do, a job meant for me and me alone, and I could not forsake my goal to get lost in a maze of philosophy.</i>

<i>These things that troubled me tonight: Makoa's betrayal, AVAEL's departure, and even still, despite the passage of time, Svetlana's death - they could be ameliorated in the ecstasy of the Hunt. And yet, I knew that was not fully true. Feasting would only provide temporary respite from the discomfort. When my hunger was sated, my friends would still be gone. But I had no desire to resist temptation right now. I felt ragged, angry, resentful. These emotions bubbled and frothed within me, threatening to overflow. But I held strong and insisted: Not tonight.</i>
