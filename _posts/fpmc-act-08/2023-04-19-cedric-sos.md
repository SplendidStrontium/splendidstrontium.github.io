<p class="ppl-sez">That is good. It is good that your soul has not been too far severed from the Dream.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">No, I'm not troubled, I just... I saw Svetlana.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That is not surprising. She was deeply connected to the Umbra. As such, she will always be close to you. You two are bound together deeply. Were you scared by what you saw?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I think I was searching for what she was like in her younger days.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That may be. When you are tied to a spirit as you are, you will find there are things you did not previously know. It will be enlightening, exhilirating. It will be exhausting.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I did not feel exhausted, I felt invigorated.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Her soul was glad to make contact.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I was happy to look upon her face again. Although there was something different about her.</p>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">If I may be so bold, I do not think there was anything changed in her, but something changed in <u>you</u>.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Why would it be reflected in such a way?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You were not looking at yourself, you were looking upon her. Your eye -- the portal to inner mystery -- has had a glass put over its aperture.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I don't want to change. I want her to recognize me.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Oh, I would not worry about that. It is as if you acquired a new pair of glasses. You may look older or younger, but your essential character is not changed.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I never thought the look suited me.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">We cannot truly alter what it is others see in us. Just as you saw things in her greater than she possibly could imagine.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">What troubles me is that her face... Seemed different.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She was many things to many people. You are seeing things you must incorporate into your perception.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wanted to save her. I knew she would perish but I was convinced, with my facility with Time, that I could go to the Time & Place that Was, and change the future.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You understand the Prohibition against attempting to overwrite the Prime Timeline.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I do. Myrtle instilled in me that fear long ago.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">And good she did. You will learn how to bring about change in a great many things but you must never think yourself so proud that you'd impress your Time upon the World.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">How is it that Davian did not invoke Paradox?</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">You know this answer but you wish to hear me repeat it. That is the right of the student. The Marscapones were a special case because in neither case had their souls left our realm. In the case of Vincent, I cannot say for certain why, but his consciousness was tied to that of his son's. And as for his mother, he captured her soul before it dissolved into the ether.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>

<div class="chat-box">

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">That is a risk we have no choice but to fear.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Just because you do not remember the experience doesn't mean it didn't happen. You should learn to put less faith in your ordinary senses.</p>

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I came up with some putrid catchphrase. S.O.S. : Save Our Svetlana. As if there were anything humorous about this loss.</p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VLAD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I do not think you were trying to invoke laughter, but merely trying to minimize your immeasurable grief. It is too great a burden for you to comprehend, much less overcome.</p>
</div>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric2.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />

<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>

### // STRAUD MANSION //

<BR><i>I could not yet do what he'd asked me to do. Conjuration: Water. Something that was once easy for me. Something I once knew how to do.</i>

<i>He insisted it was not the same. That I was collapsing matter into a measurable point. An elementalist was not that much different from one who practiced divine magicks, he said. It was a matter of favor and favors.</i>

<i>Becoming a thaumaturgist, a blood sorcerer, a Dreamer, this was something different entirely. I was using the tenuous link between the Umbra and our own universe to create change. And thus, I should not expect it to be anything like what I'd done before, when I was a Mage. I could not use the same channels, and I should not expect the same results. But it was impossible, or at least, difficult, for me to change my expectations.</i>

#### STRAUD

> YOU EXPECT A LOT OF YOURSELF. PLEASE ALLOW YOURSELF TIME TO CHANGE. 

#### CEDRIC

> DAMMIT STRAUD!! 
> 
> WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ME TO MEMORIZE TIMES TABLES!!

<BR><i>He merely stared back at me with a stern expression upon his face.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IF YOU FORCE THINGS, YOU'LL BREAK.
> 
> <u>THAT</u> IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT AFFORD.

#### CEDRIC

> I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS!

#### STRAUD

> ARE YOU NOT DIFFERENT NOW?

<BR><i>I could regard myself without the help of a mirror. A scar ran down between my eyebrows, culminating beneath my right eye. That, combined with my bleached hair, meant my childhood companions would scarcely recognize me.</i>

<i>But my visage was not the only part of me that had changed.</i>

#### STRAUD

> WAS IT NOT THIS VERY MONTH, SOME YEARS AGO, THAT YOU FOUND YOURSELF RISEN FROM BEYOND THE PALE?

#### CEDRIC

> I DON'T THINK THAT PHRASE MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS.

#### STRAUD

> WAS IT NOT THE MONTH OF APRIL?

#### CEDRIC

> YOU'RE TOYING WITH ME.

#### STRAUD

> YOU CANNOT WALK FORWARD IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYE FACED AWAY. 
> 
> FIND THE WATER IN THE DREAM.

#### CEDRIC

> I CAN'T FOCUS IF YOU KEEP STARING AT ME!!

#### STRAUD

> THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PRIVACY ON THE BATTLEFIELD. 
> 
> DO IT!!

#### CEDRIC

> WHY WATER?
> 
> WHY DID YOU CHOOSE SOMETHING SO FAR FROM WHAT I KNOW?

#### STRAUD

> WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER?
> 
> WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONJURE FIRE INSTEAD?
> 
> BRING ABOUT THE AGENT OF YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION?
> 
> END YOUR PITIFUL EXISTENCE HERE AND NOW?

<BR><i>I did not know what I wanted. I was just frustrated and confused.</i>

#### CEDRIC

> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THIS? 
> 
> YOU'VE PROVIDED ME NO INSTRUCTION!

#### STRAUD

> WHY SHOULD I BOTHER TRYING TO TEACH YOU WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW?

#### CEDRIC

> YOU SAID --

#### STRAUD

> FORGET WHAT I SAID.
