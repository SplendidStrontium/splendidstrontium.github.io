*****
<br><i>It was unseasonably cold that day, the day he'd chosen to say goodbye. To his wife, he would say nothing. There was nothing left to be said between the two of them. In the chasm lay neglect and pride. He could no longer conjure any words that meant anything to him.</i>

<i>He told his daughter, Nani, that they were going away on a very long trip and it would be too painful to say goodbye. Her mother might even try to convince them not to go. But they had to go.</i>

<i>She had accepted his reasoning. And without tears, she whispered a last farewell to the only home she'd ever known.</i>

#### NANI

> A HUI HOU, MAMA.

*****
<br><i>They would make one last visit before leaving the islands forever. He would voice his intentions to Sebastian and then prepare for the voyage to New York City. He would have to be patient with Nani, it was the first time she would have ever made such a trip.</i>

<i>He knocked on the door of the grand villa. Tzu Prano answered the door.</i>

#### TZU 

> E KOMO MAI--

<br><i>She had only just finished speaking when her eyes travelled downward to meet Nani's. Tzu dropped her coffee cup on the floor and it shattered spectacularly. Her eyes wandered back up to meet Makoa, and she was joined by Sebastian, alerted at the sound of the broken porcelain.</i>

#### TZU 

> MAKOA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

*****
<br><i>Nani was ushered off to make acquaintance with one of the maids. Makoa joined Tzu and Sebastian at the breakfast nook.</i>

#### TZU 

> MAKOA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

#### MAKOA 

> I TURNED HER INTO A VAMPIRE.

#### TZU 

> WITH WHOSE SPONSORSHIP?

#### MAKOA 

> NA MANO.

#### TZU 

> THE SHARKS? 
> 
> I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE...

<br><i>Her voice trailed off.</i>

#### SEBASTIAN 

> YES, THEY FEED ON VITAE AS DO THE KINDRED.
> 
> THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS THAT THEY ALSO FEED ON THE FLESH, THOUGH THEY DO NOT NEED IT. 
> 
> THEY KILL TO FEED.

#### MAKOA 

> SO DO MANY OF THE CONDUIT SPECIES.
> 
> WHY SHOULD WE BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY?

#### SEBASTIAN 

> YOU KNOW NOT OF THE ANCIENT MAGICKS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK.

#### MAKOA 

> I ONLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I'VE NOT BEEN INSTRUCTED.

#### SEBASTIAN 

> KA MAKANI KA'ILI ALOHA.

#### MAKOA 

> DON'T YOU DARE SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF MY ANCESTORS!

#### SEBASTIAN 

> HOW CAN I TEACH IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN?
> 
> YOU HAVE DELIBERATELY DISOBEYED THE LAWS OF OUR COTERIE BY TURNING YOUR DAUGHTER INTO AN ABOMINATION.

#### MAKOA 

> SHE IS NOT AN ABOMINATION! 
> 
> SHE HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH ETERNAL YOUTH!

#### SEBASTIAN 

> IT IS FORMED AS A CURSE WHEN BESTOWED SO YOUNG.
> 
> WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE AND HERE IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN!

#### MAKOA 

> NO. 
> 
> NANI IS DIFFERENT.

#### SEBASTIAN 

> HISTORIA EST MAGISTRA VITAE.
> 
> HISTORY IS THE TEACHER OF LIFE.
> 
> WHEN ONE DOES NOT STUDY HISTORY, ONE IS DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.
> 
> YOU HAVE NOT RESPECTED THE WISDOM THAT'S COME BEFORE YOU.
> 
> STRAUD WILL NEVER ACCEPT THIS EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF HIS PRECEPTS.

#### MAKOA 

> WHAT OF THE ZHOU DAUGHTERS?

#### SEBASTIAN 

> THEY WERE TURNED BY A FIEND.
> 
> YOU HAVE SHOWN YOURSELF TO HAVE LITTLE MORE SELF-CONTROL.

#### MAKOA 

> HOW DARE YOU!

<br><i>At this, he rose from his chair.</i>

#### MAKOA 

> I JUST WANT A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR ME AND MY PEOPLE.

#### SEBASTIAN 

> ARE THE SHARKS YOUR PEOPLE?
> 
> THEY FOLLOW NAUGHT BUT THE SCENT OF VITAE, EAGER TO CONSUME.
> 
> THEY LONG LOST THEIR REASON AGO, THINKING ONLY OF THE BEAST.
> 
> IS YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR PEOPLE? 
> 
> FOR YOU HAVE ROBBED HER OF ANY CHANCE SHE HAD AT HAPPINESS BY VALUING INSTEAD HER NAIVETE.
> 
> FLOS EST PULCHRITUDO.
> 
> THE FLOWER IS BEAUTY.
> 
> YOU HAVE SLAIN THE HEN BEFORE THE HATCH.

#### MAKOA 

> YOU'RE WRONG! 
> 
> YOU'LL SEE!

<br><i>He calls into the house, storming away from the table. Nani comes to his call, and the two disappear out the front door.</i>

<i>By the time Tzu reaches the door, only a ripple in the tide remains.</i>
