<br><i>As quickly as he'd apparently disappeared into the ocean, news spread that Makoa and his daughter had gone AWOL. I wanted to concern myself but I was preoccupied with my own troubles.</i>

<i>I needed to clear up my vision. It was clouding my relationship with Dream and finally I could stand it no longer. I was plagued with daunting visions, culminating in one of a dying dog, literally decaying due to mold and mushroom. The dog was neither dead nor alive, a state with which I could identify.</i>

<i>I would save the dog. Or, at the very least, save those around from contamination.</i>

<i>I was bound for Straud Mansion in order to find the wisest, most impartial judge I could think of rousing to the cause. One Straud himself had said was at the beginning of an important mission within Dream.</i>

<i>The painter, Hua Jia.</i>

<i>I knocked on the door. She answered.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> HUA JIA. 
> 
> I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU. 
> 
> I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

#### CEDRIC 

> ANYTHING, 西追. 
> 
> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

#### CEDRIC 

> I NEED AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER, ONE WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH DREAM. 

#### HUA JIA 

> I DO NOT KNOW IF I AM ABLE TO CONVERSE WITH 夢幻.

#### CEDRIC 

> I DO NOT THINK ANYONE EVER FEELS A MASTER OF DREAM.
> 
> YOU SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

#### HUA JIA 

> YOUR WORDS ARE KIND, BUT...
> 
> OH NEVER MIND IT.
> 
> WHAT IS IT YOU ASK OF ME?
> 
> I HAVE SWORN MYSELF TO REPAY MY DEBT.

<br><i>I had chosen her not only for her wisdom but also because I was not even sure she had ever met Kevin. She would be a blank canvas.</i>

#### CEDRIC 

> I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS SAID TO BE THE SON OF A PRINCE OF ELYSION. 
> 
> HIS VERY EXISTENCE IS MIRED IN THE DREAM.
> 
> AND JUST RECENTLY I'VE HAD A CONCERNING VISION ABOUT HIM.

#### HUA JIA 

> I WILL GO WITH YOU.

<br><i>She motioned toward my car, behind me.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> SHALL WE TAKE YOUR CAR?

#### CEDRIC 

> I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ON THE WAY.

*****
<br><i>I told her everything I knew of Kevin -- and even more about myself. I began with how I'd come to meet the Marscapones after emigrating to NYC. I detailed the quiet, solitary life he'd lived at the fringes of the Magicademy. I told her how I'd become a vampire, how Kevin and I had grown as brothers under the tutelage of Vincent.</i>

<i>I told her how Vincent had ceased corporeal existence at the hands of the Doctor Trelaine, how Kevin had soon after claimed to hear a voice in his mind, one he professed belonged to his father. And as we neared Astoria, I quickly relayed how Straud had turned him into a mage, a mage who would soon witness the resurrection of his mother and father at the hands of the illustrious Davian, thereby freeing Kevin from the clutches of his dualism.</i>

#### HUA JIA 

> IT'S QUITE A STORY, 西追.
> 
> ONE I'M NOT SURE I CAN ENTIRELY KEEP STRAIGHT.
> 
> I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I MIX UP SOME OF THE DETAILS.

#### CEDRIC 

> I DON'T BLAME YOU.
> 
> IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

#### HUA JIA 

> NOW, WHAT WAS IT YOU SAW RECENTLY?

#### CEDRIC 

> IN DECEMBER, I WENT TO THE MARSCAPONES' HOME, AND I SAW KEVIN AS I HAD NOT SEEN HIM IN YEARS, HE WAS ENTIRELY AS HE WAS WHEN I HAD MET HIM -- 
> 
> HE WAS A VAMPIRE.

#### HUA JIA 

> I SEE.
> 
> WELL, STRAUD CURED HIS VAMPIRISM, DID HE NOT?
> 
> IT IS MY IMPRESSION THAT 夢幻世界 CONSISTS OF ALL THE ALTERNATE REALITIES THAT DID NOT COME TO PASS BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES WE MADE. 
> 
> PERHAPS THIS WAS A WORLD WHERE STRAUD DID NOT -- OR WAS NOT ABLE -- TO TURN HIM INTO A MAGE.
> 
> THAT IS AN IMPRESSIVE FEAT IN ITSELF, ONE I WAS UNAWARE WAS POSSIBLE.
