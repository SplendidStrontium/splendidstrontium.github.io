### // STRAUD MANSION //

<BR><i>I showed up fully prepared to drive the Master to the B.V. but something told me that we would not be going tonight.</i>

<i>I unlocked the door with my personal set of keys. It still astounded me, each and every time I did this, the amount of trust the Master had placed in me. My old master, the Doctor Trelaine, had never given me such a gift. He had barely been comfortable with me placing my hand upon a doorknob, more content to havec me follow dutifully behind.</i>

<i>But times had changed. Straud was my Master now.</i>

#### STRAUD

> THERE IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW, MANDARC.

#### MANDARC

> YES, MASTER?

#### STRAUD

> I'VE STARTED TRAINING CEDRIC IN THE WAYS OF BLOOD SORCERY. 
> 
> IT IS NOT A MATTER OF FAVORITISM, RATHER, SOMETHING I REALIZED I WAS FINALLY READY TO DO. 
> 
> I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG TO NOT RECEIVE THIS BOON --

#### MANDARC

> WELL HE WAS A MAGE BEFORE.

#### STRAUD

> SO IS INTERRUPTING YOUR NEW TRICK?

#### MANDARC

> SORRY, MASTER.

#### STRAUD

> TRY NOT TO DO IT AGAIN.

#### MANDARC 

> YES, MASTER.

#### STRAUD

> AT ANY RATE, THE TIME FOR YOUR TRAINING WILL SOON COME BUT I DO FEEL YOU'VE NOT FULLY EXTRACTED MEANING FROM THE EXPERIENCES YOU'VE ALREADY HAD.

#### MANDARC

> SIR?

#### STRAUD

> YOU SAW SOMETHING IN THE RECORD ROOM IN SAINT LOUIE, DID YOU NOT?
> 
> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU SAW?

<BR><i>I stumbled over my thoughts. The prompt was completely out of left field.</i>

#### MANDARC

> MASTER, I...

#### STRAUD

> HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT MUCH LATELY?
> 
> THAT IS PRECISELY THE PROBLEM. 
> 
> YOU EXPERIENCED SOMETHING THERE MEANT FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE. 
> 
> THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN HELP YOU WITH WHAT YOU ARE.
> 
> ... YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH YUKI BEHR, HAVEN'T YOU?

<BR><i>My posture stiffened. Of course there was no hiding anything from him.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL FOR YOU TO SEEK COMPANIONSHIP --

#### MANDARC

> BUT SHE'S MORTAL?

#### STRAUD

> CAN YOU READ MY THOUGHTS, MANDARC?

#### MANDARC

> NO SIR...

#### STRAUD

> THEN I KINDLY ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM ACTING AS IF YOU CAN.

#### MANDARC

> SORRY, MASTER.

<BR><i>He paused, steadying himself.</i>

#### STRAUD

> IT IS NOT THAT SHE IS A MORTAL THAT TROUBLES ME. 
> 
> MORTALS ARE BROUGHT INTO THE CIRCLE OF TRUST EVERY DAY.
> 
> BUT WE MUST LOOK INTO OURSELVES AND ENSURE THAT THOSE WE LEAN ON ARE PREPARED TO CARRY THE BURDEN.

#### MANDARC

> DO YOU THINK SHE'S ILL-SUITED TO ME, SIR?

#### STRAUD

> THAT IS A DECISION YOU MUST MAKE FOR YOURSELF.

#### MANDARC

> I'M SORRY, SIR.

<BR><i>There is a momentary silence and I notice the log in the fireplace crackle and pop.</i>

#### STRAUD

> I THOUGHT MISS PERKINS WAS A POOR MATCH FOR YOU.

<BR><i>His words cause a rise of indignation, embarrassment. He was rarely so forward.</i>

#### MANDARC

> SIR! 
> 
> IF YOU THOUGHT THAT, WHY DID YOU LET --

#### STRAUD

> BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE. 
> 
> WHO AM I TO STAND IN THE WAY OF LOVE?

#### MANDARC

> BUT SIR!

#### STRAUD

> I HOPED YOUR KINDNESS AND PURITY WOULD WIN HER OVER AND INVOKE A CHANGE IN HER. 
> 
> BUT SHE DESIRED SOMETHING YOU COULD NOT OFFER HER.
> 
> IT WAS A TRAGEDY WE COULD NOT BRING HER TO THE LIGHT.

#### MANDARC

> I REGRET THE WHOLE THING.

#### STRAUD

> DON'T WASTE PRECIOUS SECONDS ON REGRETS. 
> 
> YOU ARE GREATER NOW THAN YOU WERE. 
> 
> YOUR HEART IS FULLER NOW THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE.
> 
> TO BE LOVED IN RETURN IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL, BUT THAT IS A MORE COMPLICATED MATTER.

#### MANDARC

> DO YOU THINK YUKI LOVES ME?

#### STRAUD 

> WHATEVER IT IS SHE FEELS, I CANNOT SAY, BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HER FEELINGS ARE BASED ON INCOMPLETE INFORMATION.
> 
> SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.
> 
> <u>WHO</u> YOU ARE.

#### MANDARC

> SHOULD I TELL HER, SIR?
> 
> IS SHE READY?

#### STRAUD

> SHE WILL NEVER BE READY.
> 
> BUT THAT IS NOT MY CONCERN.
> 
> I AM CONCERNED WITH YOU AND WHETHER YOU ARE READY TO TAKE ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

#### MANDARC

> SIR?

#### STRAUD

> BECAUSE ONCE SHE LEAVES THE MORTAL SHROUD SHE IS YOUR CHARGE FOR THE REST OF HER DAYS.
> 
> IT IS NOT LIKE FORMING BONDS WITH THE AWAKENED. 
> 
> YUKI WILL HAVE HER WORLD SHATTERED WHEN YOU REVEAL THE TRUTH. 
> 
> AND SHE WILL COME TO LOOK TO YOU TO PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.

#### MANDARC

> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY TO DO THAT.

#### STRAUD

> YOU MAY NOT BE TODAY, BUT YOU WILL BE.

#### MANDARC

> WHAT'S THE PHRASE I'M LOOKING FOR?
> 
> "ONCE BITTEN, TWICE SHY"?
