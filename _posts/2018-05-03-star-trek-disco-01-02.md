## Philippa Georgiou - Seeming is Believing

The new Captain is stately, but does she pass muster? She is a bit like the bridge of her ship the Shenzhou -- a bit too futuristic and with none of the familiar motifs of the original. Sometimes you'd wish they'd step in a slice of tomato so that you could get a different expression on their face. But of course that will never happen because everything feels as stiffly scripted as the opening sequence when Captain Georgiou leads Commander Michael Burnham on a walk in the desert to form a Starfleet symbol in the sand (P.S. Windy?). All the bridge scenes back up the feeling that austerity trumps truthiness. The officers are all very flippant with each other. Proving their personal bravado ends up being more important than their goal of peace-making in the galaxy. The Captain is probably the most likeable character in the first episode and she does her best with what she is given.

## is Starfleet a Military? Look to the intro animations

The new series has an opening sequence that praises technology by turning it into something it is not: mystical and composed of lines and thought. It shows visuals of Star Trek technology pieces and though it's visually impressive, it makes a mockery of how these objects would actually work. Where ENT's intro was selling short the distance between sea-travel and faster-than-light space travel, DISCO forgets about the journey entirely to suppose that Star Trek is made of futuro-guns and pseudo-religious iconography. It steals the symbols while doing so little service to its forefathers. In what war do we fight? Culture wars with Klingons!! Waged with the symbols of diplomacy stolen from previous generations!

## What's the deal with a boy's name for a lady?

I don't know and I'm not sure.

## Old tropes or bad writing?

I really wish we'd do away with senseless plot hooks like sending high-ranking officers on away missions to strange artifacts protected by nothing else than a spacesuit, but maybe I'm asking too much of those who crave drama constantly in their TV. Ah, but the drama is oversold too; the scene where Michael floats through the 'object of unknown origin' she says "the only word to effectively describe it is 'wow'" -- What a terrible, terrible piece of writing. But I guess I should redact my previous statement because she is in perfect garb to kill a Klingon. Diplomacy with other races? Worf be damned!

## These are not your father's Klingons...

No, indeed they are not. They are space-orcs who make you read subtitles.

## Why did they need to kill the Klingons again?

Why?
