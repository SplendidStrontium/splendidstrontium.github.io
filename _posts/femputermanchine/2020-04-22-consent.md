## ACT 1

<i>flyby of suburban town in somewhere, America. April. visuals are idyllic ~ tending toward "a little too perfect" with musical hinting. through the montage, we see the sun is setting. </i>

<i>The flybys get closer to the ground and pan over CEDRIC, 25, out for a jog. He is a young man with soft light-brown hair. He has a tense expression on his face as he jogs on the pressed dirt edging the street and wilderness. By the montage, he has been jogging from afternoon to the twilight. </i>

<i>A car is driving down the street. The car is being driven by HERMIONE, 18-20YO. In the passenger seat is LARRY, 17, who is bending around the seat to talk to R, seated anxiously in the backseat of the car. It is not apparent what the boys are talking about. Hermione is tense driving on the curved, forested road. </i>

<i>She is pushing the limits of her driving ability and makes a mistake. Around a bend, she doesn't turn enough and she slips off the road and strikes CEDRIC, sending him backward into the woody brush. </i>

* LARRY

HERMIONE, DID YOU JUST HIT SOMEONE?

<i>HERMIONE is terrified. She stops the car and runs to the body she's struck. Larry and R leave the car and follow behind her. Between the setting sun and the surrounding trees, it is getting darker. Ron is hunched over, already disturbed. He turns his cellphone on flashlight.</i>

* HERMIONE

OH-- 

<i>HERMIONE brings her hands to her face in shock, and then she tries to pull at the broken brush around CEDRIC</i>

IT'S CEDRIC!

* LARRY

SHI--

<i>LARRY stops mid-word as we see HERMIONE is trying to pick up the unconscious CEDRIC. He and R rush forward to assist laying CEDRIC on the ground.</i>

<i>This is the first close-up of CEDRIC's face. He looks the part of an high-achieving, now-graduate, of the school shared between the four young adults. His face is relaxed, as if asleep. The three recognize the blow to his torso is a mortal wound. </i>

<i>HERMIONE twitches to hold back tears. She struggles to get words out.</i>

* HERMIONE

I... 

* LARRY

(while looking around) WHY WON'T ANYONE...

* HERMIONE
