### VATORE MANSION INTERIOR ###

<I>Stretched across her bed in her home is LILITH VATORE, a young vampire with black hair and a serious cut to her jib. Her motions suggest a young woman in her young twenties, but she frowns as she flips through her phone idly, betraying a loneliness matured.</i>

<i>She paces about the room; she's trying to make a decision. She finally goes for it, grabs her phone, and pens a short message addressed to a 'QUARQ'.</I>

<i>A few minutes pass; but Lilith's pacing about the bedroom makes it feel like she's tied a rope around her neck and thrown herself in a river.</I>

<i>LILITH inhales and exhales a sigh of relief. </i>

## QUARQ PENTHOUSE EXTERIOR ##

<I>The next day, LILITH travels to his apartment. QUARQ's apartment is the top floor of a new-build in Brooklyn. The street is relatively quiet; only a few people trickle around, at this time of night mostly on their way home.</i>

<i>LILITH rings the buzzer for the penthouse. She's dressed to the nines and a passerby gives her a solid looking down but if she notices, she doesn't give any indication.</i>

### QUARQ ###

> COME ON UP.

<i>Inside, the decorations are sparse but extremely tidy. Black tiles shine brightly and beige plaster downplays the walls. A few paintings line the wall, fresh flowers in a vase decorate a quiet corner. A doorman's station lays unattended.</i>

<i>The elevator goes straight up to the penthouse uninterrupted. QUARQ answers the door. He is dressed in a finely tailored suit, though he lacks a tie. </i>

### QUARQ ###

> WELCOME, M'LADY, TO BROOKLYN.

<i>He takes her hand and kisses it in a showy gesture.</i>

### LILITH ###

> DON'T YOU MEAN 'BOO'-KLYN?

<I>QUARQ laughs after standing up straight again.</i>

### QUARQ ###

> WHAT A TERRIBLE JOKE. AND NEVER MENTION THAT NAME IN MY HOUSE AGAIN!

<I>His tone is jovial.</i>

> AND SPEAKING OF MY HOUSE, WELCOME WELCOME.

<I>A well-furnished kitchen greets the visitor, marble counters lend an air of sophistication to what is otherwise a simple apartment. There is ample seating; couches, a dining table, a small bar -- all to enhance a feel of intimacy despite the enormous glass windows. </i>

<i>QUARQ allows the room to sit in silence for a few minutes while LILITH observes the space. She stands for a few moments to look down toward a small local park. There is little motion. </i>

### QUARQ ###

> CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?

<I>LILITH turns around.</i>

> SHAKEN OR STIRRED?

<I>LILITH seems to genuinely think about the question.</i>

### LILITH ###

> Y'KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. GIVE ME A SEC.

<I>She looks out the window at the park.</i>

### QUARQ ###

> I... UH... DON'T KNOW, ACTUALLY.

> Y'KNOW, I'VE GOT JUST THE THING. 

> FROM THE OLD MAN'S PERSONAL RESERVE.

<I>LILITH, QUARQ share a plasma pack moment.</i>

## // CHG VISUAL // ##

### QUARQ ###

> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY DID THE SIX-WEEK, CAN YOU? GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT MONEY REALLY CAN BUY ANYTHING. (pause) NOT THAT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER ARE SO BAD OFF YOURSELF!

<I>But LILITH seems distracted. </i>

> YOU SEEM TROUBLED TONIGHT, MY DEAR  -- AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOUR COMPANY I'M SENSING YOUR VISIT IS NO TRIFLE.

### LILITH ###

> HAS THE OLD CAPTAIN EVER TOLD YOU ANYTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY? MY FATHER, MY MOTHER?

### QUARQ ###

> WHY NO, MY CHILD. 'THE OLD CAPTAIN' AND I -- DON'T TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT.
