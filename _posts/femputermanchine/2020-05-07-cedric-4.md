<i>CEDRIC is back in the basement, staring at a lighted mobile of the solar system. He whispers something to himself.</i>

<i>Again, a footfall on the creaky stairs. It is LARRY. He has a WAND in his hand. LARRY'S WAND is about 10inches long and made of mid-tone rosey wood.</i>

<i>He reaches the bottom of the stairs and looks around, but the basement is very dark.</i>

```
LARRY

(waving wand) LUMINOSITY, FIND THE LIGHT OF DAY!
```

<I>Photons fall from CEDRIC's body into LARRY's WAND, leaving his wand alit and CEDRIC transformed into a grey wolf-pup.</i>

<i>CEDRIC-PUP growls at LARRY'S WAND but otherwise is transfixed in space.</i>

<i>LARRY walks up to the small dog and picks him up by the scruff of his neck. He puts the dog into a large leather pouch.</i>

```
LARRY

(chuckling) Little bites too big for your bark, little one.
```

<i>LARRY walks up the glowing mobile and places one of the glass planets between his fingers and smashes the glass between his fingers.</i>
