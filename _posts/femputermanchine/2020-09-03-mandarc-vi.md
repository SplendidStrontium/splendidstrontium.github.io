You are my moonbeam
parody of 
you are my sunshine
originally by the 
pine ridge boys

I had a day-mare, as I lay dozing
a fevered vision of time gone by
you were a doll, dear, and I a skel'ton
and I knew we both had died

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam
you break my debuffs when times are blue
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two
please don't make my moonbeam askew

a secret shared, girl, became a lover
each morning bless-ed by your sweet kiss
but now you're wishing to be my brother
lasting 'wake is no such bliss

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam
you break my debuffs when times are blue
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two
please don't make my moonbeam askew

your voice a chorus of fotons merry
your gentle eying warms me so  
but if your Talent, you leave behind you
you'll regret it all some day 

// chorus:

you are my moonbeam, my only moonbeam
you break my debuffs when times are blue
i hope you'll see, girl, how much we need two
please don't make my moonbeam askew
