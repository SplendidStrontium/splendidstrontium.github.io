## // STRAUD MANSION // ##

<i>When MANDARC arrives at Straud Mansion, he hears the sound of pipe organ emanating from behind the door.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> (thinking) At least the Master is in good spirits...

<i>MANDARC enters; STRAUD stops his work. The room becomes heavy without the song's comfort. Without yet turning around, he speaks.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> DID YOU CHECK ON CUMMINGS?

<I>MANDARC looks down, then at the back of STRAUD's head. </i>

### MANDARC ###

> YES OF COURSE I DID, SIR. SHE WAS THERE; AT LEAST I HEARD HER VOICE -- BUT THE ONE WHO ANSWERED THE DOOR --

### STRAUD ###

> YES, I AM AWARE.

<I>STRAUD turns around halfway to look at MANDARC with one eye.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> YOU KNOW THE GIRL.

### MANDARC ###

> YES, SIR. "WENDY"; MCCOY'S DAUGHTER.

<I>At this STRAUD turns around entirely but remains seated at his organ.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO CALL HER A "CREATION".

### MANDARC ###

> ... SIR?

<I>STRAUD stands up.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> THAT GIRL IS A FLESH GOLEM, ANIMATED. A "GHOLA", IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT TOME...

### MANDARC ###

> I AM NOT, MASTER, BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN ME.

### STRAUD ###

> IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE.

> ...

> "FLESH GOLEM" IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSES.

> I TRUST YOU FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS?

### MANDARC ###

> I FEAR MY FACE REVEALED TOO MUCH.

### STRAUD ###

> I KNEW OF THAT RISK WHEN I SENT YOU THERE.

> BUT I FELT YOU NEEDED TO SEE HER WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

### MANDARC ###

> I DO -- ERR -- I DID...

### STRAUD ###

> (interrupting) DID YOU EVER CONSUMMATE A UNION?

<I>MANDARC freezes in place. If he could blush, he would be.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> MASTER...

### STRAUD ###

> MANDARC, THIS IS IMPORTANT. DID YOU EVER EVEN KISS THE GIRL? DID SHE EVER HOLD YOUR HAND?

### MANDARC ###

> NO SIR. NEVER.

### STRAUD ###

> GOOD. THAT IS ADVANTAGEOUS. FOR US.

> SHE'LL HAVE CERTAIN FLASHES OF MEMORY OF THE PAST, BUT --

### MANDARC ###

> SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE ME.

<I>STRAUD listens intently.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> SHE STARED AT ME, SORT OF COCKED HER HEAD TO ONE SIDE.

> LIKE A DOG MIGHT.

### STRAUD ###

> APT OBSERVATION.

> HER MEMORIES ARE IN HER MUSCLE, HER TENDON, HER NERVE.

> THEY HAVE PLACED HER THERE, LIKE A DOG, TO DEFEND THEIR PROPERTY.

> AND TO DISTRACT YOU FROM OUR GOAL.

<I>MANDARC recalls the way in which BOBBIE yelled for her as if for a dog. Brusque and unfeeling. An undeserved command.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> BUT WHY DEFEND BOBBIE? EVEN IF THEY RECONVERTED HER, SHE'S...

### STRAUD ###

> I DON'T KNOW, ENTIRELY. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT ELUDES ME.

> ANYONE COULD DEFEND BOBBIE. THE FACE IS SURELY INTENDED AS A TAUNT DIRECTED TOWARD YOU. THAT MUCH IS EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS AT.

> BUT BOBBIE HERSELF IS LITTLE THREAT ENOUGH.

> I'M NOT EVEN SO SURE WHY THEY KEPT HER ALIVE AFTER WE TOOK FROM HER THE GIFT.

> A SHOW TO THEIR FOLLOWERS, SOME FARCE, A DISPLAY OF SUPPOSED LOYALTY.

> NO. IT IS CUMMINGS WHO GUARDS WENDY. BUT WHY? 

> THERE MUST BE MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE BETWEEN THE TWO AND THEY ARE HOPING TO LURE YOU IN. 

> SO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

### MANDARC ###

> SIR, I...

### STRAUD ###

> CAN'T BE TRUSTED? IF I'D HAVE HAD ANY QUALMS ABOUT YOU, YOU WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE.

> NO, I TRUST YOU ENTIRELY.

> YOU ARE WHAT THEY WANT. THAT'S WHY THEY CHOSE HER.

> THERE ARE MORE ENEMIES OUTSIDE THAN THERE ARE FRIENDS.

> THE SOONER I DISPATCH THE ILLUSIONS, THE BETTER.

> THE SOONER THE DOCTOR REALIZES HIS OWN FALSE FRIENDS THE SOONER WE CAN FIND THE FACE OF THE TRUE ENEMY.

> HE'D SET HIS OWN FOOT AFLAME TO DAMN A SPOT AND TAKE THE WHOLE BOAT WITH HIM.

> NEITHER I NOR THE NSR IS SO FOOLISH.

> IF SHE TRULY IS A SIMPLETON THEN HER LOYALTIES ARE HER OWN.

> DO YOU LOVE HER?

<I>MANDARC is stupified in silence.</i>

### STRAUD ### 

> THEN IT'S SETTLED. YOU'LL KEEP SURVEILLANCE UNTIL I TELL YOU TO RETURN.

### MANDARC ###

> ... NO, I CAN'T DO THIS.

### STRAUD ### 

> YES YOU CAN, AND YOU WILL. BESIDES -- I'M NOT SENDING YOU ALONE.

### MANDARC ### 

> SURELY SOMEONE WITH A MORE NEUTRAL OUTLOOK...

> CEDRIC.

### STRAUD ###

> HE IS BUSIED WITH OTHER TASKS.

### MANDARC ###

> ROXANNE. OBOROVSKY. MAKOA.

### STRAUD ###

> NEUTRALITY IS ONE OF THE ILLUSIONS I'M TRYING TO DISPEL. NEUTRALITY IS A CONCEPT COOKED UP BY FOOLS AND EMPLOYED BY CHILDREN AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN EITHER. 

> NO; THIS IS A COMMAND.

> YOU WILL RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF MYRTLE MARSCAPONE AND CONDUCT YOUR OPERATION WITH HER GUIDANCE.

> THE OLD BROAD IS TERRIBLY FOND OF YOU.

### MANDARC ###

> AND I, HER.

### STRAUD ### 

> TRY NOT TO SUFFER WHAT YOU WANT OR WHAT YOU FEEL CAPABLE OF, SOME ODD OUTCROPPING OF BRAVERY OR DESIRE.

> NOTHING CAN GO MORE WRONG THAN IT ALREADY HAS, THINGS SET IN MOTION LONG BEFORE YOU WERE RAISED TO SENTIENCE.

> PAIN'S WORST MOMENTS ARE ALWAYS IN FRONT OF US, LINGERING, TEASING US A HUNDRED, A THOUSAND FOLD THEIR TRUE THREAT.

### MANDARC ###

> "FEAR IS THE MIND-KILLER".

### STRAUD ###

> ...

> INDEED.

### MANDARC ###

> WHAT ARE MY INSTRUCTIONS?

### STRAUD ###

> INSTRUCTIONS? I HAVE NONE.

> I'LL NOT BE GRANTING CUMMINGS ENTRANCE TO OUR SOCIETY; NO, HER LOYALTIES ARE QUITE CLEAR TO ME.

> I PRAY THE DOCTOR SEES THE SAME BUT HE'S NOT THE MAN I ONCE CALLED FRIEND.

> AS FOR WENDY, I REFUSE TO SPECULATE ANY MORE. PERHAPS MYRTLE CAN HELP YOU.
