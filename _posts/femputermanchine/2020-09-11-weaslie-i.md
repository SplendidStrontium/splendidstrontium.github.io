### STRAUD MANSION ###

<i>The stone monstrosity stands alone on a snow-covered hill. Two men have just left their turquoise vehicle. "thonk thonk" go their footsteps, compressing the fresh snow beneath their shoes. Neither of them are terribly well-dressed for the weather. </i>

<i>Inside the Mansion, a heavyset red-haired man hears their footsteps. As soon as they reach the top step, he pulls open the mausoleum door. </i>

### BRONALD ###

> FRIENDS, WELCOME.

<I>BRONALD bows to the two men. It is CEDRIC, KEVIN. </i>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH WHATEVER FUCKFACE IS MANDARC HERE YET?

<i>BRONALD stops for a moment. He was clearly not expecting the casual profanity from CEDRIC. </i>

<i>But BRONALD just pauses before speaking again. </i>

### BRONALD ###

> (terse) SIRS, THE MASTER IS NOT AT HOME.

<I>CEDRIC stops cold in his feet.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> EXCUSE ME?

<I>BRONALD grits his teeth. He hates repeating himself.</i>

### BRONALD ###

> (carefully) THE MASTER IS NOT HERE.

<I>CEDRIC stops, news he's not expecting to hear. </i>

<i>CEDRIC's cellphone buzzes. </i>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">MANDARC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">sry omw</p>
</div>

<i>CEDRIC looks back toward the door, still lying open. The other three stand awkwardly in the doorway. A brief rush of snow and then standing in front of them is the young man MANDARC SOO. </i>

<i>Unlike CEDRIC & KEVIN, MANDARC is dressed warmly in a black velvet fur-lined coat. His VAMPIRIC SPEED has brought him inside the house in a moment's glance. </i>

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">KEVIN//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Charmed.</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN thrusts out his hand toward MANDARC. The two shake cordially. </i>

<i>Suddenly the door begins to close behind them. </i>

### BRONALD ###

> (straining while pushing the door) ENOUGH OF THE PLEASANTRIES! THE MASTER ISN'T HERE.

<i>When the door closes, BRONALD quickly melts into rose petals. In his place appears a slim man with silvered hair.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-happy.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Welcome.</p>
</div>

> SO MY ILLUSION IS DONE. BUT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH HIM, YET.

<I>In Straud's palm is a small shining disc. He holds his palm toward the ceiling and the thing emits a hologram. It looks strikingly similar to the man who disappeared in a flash of petals, but younger.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> BRONALD WEASLIE, ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE. HE'S OUT THERE, SADLY. I MISSED ONE.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevcropped.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">YOU... WHAT?</p>
</div>

<I>What follows causes the men to wince as if hearing a piercing wail. ALL FOUR cover their ears.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> I MISSED ONE!

> BUT I LEFT HIM AS A PLANT.

### CEDRIC ###

> (after straightening his posture) A ... PLANT?

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/kevin-thinks.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />

</div>

### STRAUD ###

> YES, A PLANT. IF YOU ALL WOULD SHUT UP. I LEFT HIM TO SPY ON McCOY'S FOOLS.

<I>At this, the entire group does a double-take.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> McCOY...?

### CEDRIC ###

> THAT OLD CODGER FROM YOUR HOMEWORLD?

<i>STRAUD curls over to clasp his forehead in embarrassment.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> (quietly) BOSS...

### STRAUD ###

> (fiercely) YES I KNOW BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THIS TIME. THIS GUY ... WELL. HE HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS. POWERFUL. LET'S NOT --

<i>The side of someone's fist hits the door loudly five times.</i>

### FRIDAY PERKINS ###

> MANDARC!! (pounding again) I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!! 

<div class="chat-box">
