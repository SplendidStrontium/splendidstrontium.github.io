## // MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME // ##

<I>The day of the week is Sunday. The usual day of the week for MYRTLE MARSCAPONE's grand feast.</i>

<i>Today, KEVIN MARSCAPONE prepares to rise from bed. His back aches, as it usually did after a night of sleep. And yet, he did not long for the coffin he once took peace in.</i>

<i>No, that life had denied him any possibility of peace.</i>

<i>It's early, but it barely seems it. The spring has brought with it the light of the Sun.</i>

<i>He rolls over, trying to ease the pain in his back's curvature. But it provides little relief. He's in a foul mood.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> PLEASE, FATHER. WAS THAT YOUR MEMORY? MOTHER AND YOU ALONE ON A CRUISE SHIP?

<I>KEVIN has had an unpleasant dream.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I didn't see.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">But,</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I can't, at the moment, recall a time your mother and I enjoyed a vacation.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> IT WAS A LAND OF ICE. AND A NUMBER OF FROZEN LOCKS.

> CANALS.

> I FELT THAT I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD AND EACH ICY SLIDE, LEADING OUT FROM A CENTRAL POINT LIKE A STARBURST, LED TO ITS OWN PROGRESSION OF FALLING LATITUDES.

<p class="ppl-sez">Sounds beautiful.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

> I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY MOTHER NEEDED TO BE THERE.

> THAT'S WHY I WONDERED IF IT WAS ONE OF YOURS.

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She wasn't always old, you know.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> THAT'S NICE.

<I>It's time to get up from the bed. KEVIN wanders into the bathroom. He eyes himself in the mirror.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> (thinking) Gotta work in a shower and a shave if I'm going to see Mom today.

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Have you noticed the hairline?</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN reaches up and pulls his hair back from his forehead. It's always been a source of irritation for him; he had started to notice thinning about the temples soon after his teenage years had neared their end.</i>

<i>It had seemed to worsen after his father's death.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">It's growing back.</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN continues to hold back his hair, leaning in toward the mirror, inspecting the tiny vellus hair.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> I HAD SUSPECTED AS MUCH BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING MUCH MIND.

<I>Matters concerning vanity had slowly slipped from his concern. The fa√ßade a necessary evil, occasionally an inconvenience as a window to the emotional torrents within.</i>
