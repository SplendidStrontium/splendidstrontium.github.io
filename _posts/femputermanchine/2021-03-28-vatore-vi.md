## // VATORE MANSION // ##

<I>Standing on the steps of his childhood home in Jamaica Estates is the young vampire CALEB VATORE.</i>

<i>After his sister left with the strange vampire QUARQ without so much as an annoucement -- one night away became two, became three... -- CALEB was filled with rage. He seethed and ran away, traveling from couch to couch carrying only the barest of essentials. </i>

<i>But all welcomes had begun to wear thin.</i>

<i>Even his correspondence with the Moon Priestess had begun to slow. CALEB despaired.</i>

<i>Until one day, a terse message had rung upon his phone.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">Go. Home.</p>
</div>

*****

<i>And that was that.</i>

<i>CALEB had long-ago encountered the legend of the Moon Priestess in a picture book he'd found filed away in his father's things. He was enchanted by the tale, fixated with the tale of a young woman who lived in the Moon and would someday descend to Earth and slay the evil-doers.</i>

<i>One night, one of the last true Dreams before his Curse took hold, he met the shining woman in his sleep. </i>

<i>Never again was he the same.</i>

*****

<i>Two weeks he's been living out of boxes.</i>

<i>CALEB pitters out a few notes at his father's white piano. In his readmittance to the family homestead, he's decided to take up residence in his father's old room, quiet since his death.</i>

### CALEB ###

> (thinking) I wish he'd taught me to play...

<i>He sighs.</i>

> NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

<I>He pulls his cellphone from inside his breast pocket.</i>

</div>

<i>CALEB goes downstairs to wait by the door.</i>

<i>The corners of the floor are dusty; he's been too lazy to clean since returning home.</i>

<i>He fiddles with a chess set, admiring the hand-carved pieces.</i>

### CALEB ###

> (thinking) More of Father's work...

<i>The whirr of a car rushes by, drawing CALEB's attention.</i>

<i>But it couldn't be the Moon Priestess.</i>

### CALEB ###

> (thinking) She's a shapeshifter.

<i>Suddenly, his phone buzzes to life. The sort of repetitive, impatient buzzing of multiple messages coming in at once, as if after a lapse of connectivity.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/cedric1.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">CEDRIC//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">hey man </p>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/straud-strainedsmile.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">STRAUD//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Caleb.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I heard through the grapevine that you've returned home.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Your father would be so proud.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I haven't seen your sister around and I had hoped she wouldn't let the house fall into disrepair.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I had such high hopes for her.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She has left so much upon your shoulders.</p>
</div>

<i>A sharp rapping on the door. He rises from his seat and steps toward the door when the phone buzzes one more time.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/lilith-fine.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">LILITH//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Have you talked to Joelle?</p>
</div>

<center>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</center>

<i>And CALEB silences his phone and slips it back into his pocket.</i>

<i>When the door swings open, standing in front of him is a thin woman, just shorter than he, with bright pink hair. Part of it is separated into braids ornamented with hanging circles.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> VATORE. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

<i>CALEB is on edge from the messages he's hidden in his pocket.</i>

<i>He stammers a bit. He hasn't seen the Moon Priestess in months.</i>

### CALEB ###

> PLEASE, COME IN.

<I>The entryway is barren save a modest wooden table adorned with an oil lamp.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.

<I>CALEB closes the door behind her; the dull illumination from the cloudy day is obscured by the heavy door.</i>

<i>TRENTE stands awkwardly in the doorway, maintaining an arm's length from CALEB.</i>

### CALEB ###

> WELL I'M STILL UNPACKING...

### TRENTE ###

> I WAS POURING OVER THE PUBLIC RECORDS AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS A BID IN FOR THIS PLACE TO BE REPOSSESSED UNDER CAUSE OF ABANDONMENT.

> A NUMBER OF SIGNATURES COLLECTED UNDER A PETITION FOR A NEW VETERINARY OFFICE IN THE AREA.

> WHAT A JOKE.

### CALEB ###

> THEY CAN DO THAT?

<I>TRENTE scoffs.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. DOESN'T MAKE IT MEAN ANYTHING.

> I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE PRESENT IN THE SPACE.

> IT WOULD BE A PITY TO SEE YOUR FATHER'S HOME TURNED INTO SOME COMMERCIAL TRASH HEAP.

### CALEB ###

> I WASN'T GONE ALL THAT --

### TRENTE ###

> THE MAGGOTS ARE QUICK TO JUMP UPON THE FLESH.

> BUT ON TO HAPPIER THINGS.

<I>CALEB waits for the woman to speak, still struck by her reappearance.</i>

> THAT FAVOR I ASKED OF YOU. WELL, IT'S BECOME TWO THINGS.

> FIRST, I MUST ASK YOU --

> YOU AREN'T STILL CALLING ME RINI, ARE YOU?

### CALEB ###

> I...

### TRENTE ###

> I'M SORRY TO BE SO NOSY...

<I>She raises her hand to fiddle with one of her braids.</i>

> BUT THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER, I NOTICED -- ON YOUR PHONE -- YOU'D PROGRAMMED ME IN AS RINI.

> COULD YOU CHANGE THAT?

<I>CALEB pauses, apologetic.</i>

> IT'S NOT MUCH, REALLY... I KNOW THAT WAS YOUR FATHER'S NAME FOR ME, BUT... I'D PREFER IF YOU USED MY NAME. MY REAL NAME. THE ONE MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME.

<I>CALEB retreives the phone from his pocket, a rush of shame overcoming him as he fears the population of messages from STRAUD's followers.</i>

<i>But the phone has been silent.</i>

<i>He quickly presses into his contacts directory and scrolls down to the entry for the Moon Priestess.</i>

<i>TRENTE looks over his shoulder.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> AND PLEASE, LET ME GIVE YOU A NEW PICTURE OF MYSELF.

> I AM NOT A GIRL. I NO LONGER WEAR FLOWERS IN MY HAIR.

> IT'S A LOVELY SHOT BUT... 

<I>She removes from her pocket her own cellphone and punches into it furiously.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/trente-gratstb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">TRENTE//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">This one is much better.</p>
</div>

<i>A silence falls over the room after the task is complete.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> AGAIN I'M SORRY FOR BEING SO NOSY.

> I JUST... NAMES...

<I>CALEB replaces the phone into his jacket.</i>

### CALEB ###

> PLEASE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

> I'M SORRY I WAS USING A NAME ...

<I>Her expression softens, trying to offer assurance to the young man.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> IT WAS A WONDERFUL NAME. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

> 'WAS'.

<I>The pair look into each other's eyes for a moment, the greeting beginning to fade into comraderie.</i>

> NOW PLEASE. MY SECOND REQUEST.

> YOUR FAMILY. YOU BROUGHT THEM TO THIS PLACE WITH YOU?

### CALEB ###

> I DON'T HAVE MUCH FAMILY TO SPEAK OF...

<I>His eyes wander in embarrassment toward the floor.</i>

> MY COUSIN WAS SLEEPING ON HER FRIEND'S COUCH. 

> SHE WANTED TO BRING ALONG HER GREAT AUNT -- OR AT LEAST --

> SHE CALLED HER A GREAT AUNT. BUT I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED IN OR SOMETHING -- FATHER HAD NO RECORD --

### TRENTE ###

> OH THAT IS WONDERFUL. IT IS GOOD TO HEAR YOU WON'T BE ALONE IN THIS HOUSE.

> WHERE ARE THEY NOW? UPSTAIRS?

### CALEB ### 

> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OUT OF THEIR ROOMS ALL DAY. I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.

<I>TRENTE removes her shoes, sliding them underneath the foyer table.</i>

> CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?

### TRENTE ###

> OF COURSE. I WOULD LOVE A LITTLE SOMETHING.

<I>The two walk through the sparse hallway into the kitchen. A pair of barstools oppose a black countertop.</i>

<i>The kitchen is slightly untidy; a number of glasses sit adjacent to the sink.</i>

<i>CALEB removes a small purple fruit from a basket beneath the bar. He cuts it into quarters, removing the pit and setting it aside.</i>

<i>He has a press in hand when TRENTE's cellphone buzzes loudly. He continues to prepare the beverage while she scrolls over the phone, her expression darkening.</i>

<i>CALEB tries to feign at normalcy by remaining silent. But his curiosity overtakes him when she grimaces at the words on the screen.</i>

### CALEB ###

> IS SOMETHING... WRONG?

<I>She doesn't respond for a moment, engrossed in her device.</i>

<i>But then she puts it face down upon the bar.</i>

<i>Her eyes are closed when she begins to speak, but seeks eye contact as she continues.</i>

### TRENTE ###

> YES... UNFORTUNATELY. 

> I CAN'T STAY WITH YOU. I NEED TO LEAVE.

> BUT BEFORE I GO...

### CALEB ###

> YES?

### TRENTE ###

> PLEASE. WATCH OUT FOR YOUR COUSIN. 

> I JUST GET THIS FEELING... THAT...

> SHE WANTS YOU.

> COUSINS CAN BE DISGUSTING IN THAT WAY.

<i>She picks up the phone from the marble.</i>

### CALEB ###

> WHAT? JOELLE?

### TRENTE ###

> YES. JOELLE.

> SHE LOVED YOUR FATHER. THAT'S WHY SHE ELECTED TO COME WITH YOU.

> ANYONE IN HER POSITION WOULD AIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

<I>CALEB has stopped squeezing the fruit.</i>

> THAT GLASS BACK THERE -- HERS?

<I>He looks behind him, the collection of glasses each hazy with the remains of fruit pulp.</i>

### CALEB ###

> WE DID TALK OVER A FEW DRINKS...

### TRENTE ###

> THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN INNOCENT DRINK.

> IF SHE COMES NEAR YOU, PROTECT YOURSELF.

> DO WHAT YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE DONE.

### CALEB ###

> MY ... FATHER?

### TRENTE ###

> SHE'S YOUR COUSIN!

> STAKE HER THROUGH THE HEART.

> USE YOUR FATHER'S STOCK, I'M SURE THEY'RE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOUSE...

> RUN THE HEARTWOOD TO THE SOURCE.

> BE SAFE, CALEB.

<i>TRENTE disappears from the kitchen. CALEB hears the slam of the front door and she has gone from the house.</i>
