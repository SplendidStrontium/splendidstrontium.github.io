## // MARSCAPONE APARTMENTS // ##

<i>The morning has rolled around and the light levels in CEDRIC's apartment are rising. A distant bird tweets some song intelligible only to him.</i>

<i>Today is the day of the big trip.</i>

<i>MANDARC has been tasked with retreiving his lost pup. That means a journey. It means an impending battle with the mage and her white knight.</i>

<i>At the edge of CEDRIC's coffin sits the cat, TOONCES.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> MORNING, CATZOR. HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

<I>The cat is bright-eyed. She meows.</i>

> FOOD? 

> STUPID CAT.

<I>CEDRIC leaves the room and proceeds to feed the cat.</i>

<i>When KEVIN arrives at the auxiliary apartments, he enters through the front door. Of course. He has a key, after all.</i>

<i>CEDRIC is sitting in the front room, casually perusing a book.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MORNING. HOW GOES IT.

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL ENOUGH. I'VE SET UP MY FORWARDING SO I'LL KNOW ABOUT THE JOB SOON.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/avael-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">AVAEL//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Greetings, Conjurer.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> AVAEL.

### CEDRIC ###

> WE SHOULD DROP THE KEYS OFF FOR THE LITTLE GUY TO G.H.

### KEVIN ###

> SOUNDS PRUDENT.

<I>The pair leave the left complex of apartments and head over to the corner lot. The corner of Church and Ascot.</i>

<i>KEVIN has a set of keys, so the door is of no issue.</i>

<i>Outside, AGNES, his mother's friend, is cutting lilies.</i>

### AGNES ###

> GOOD MORNING, KEVIN. HOPE ALL FINDS YOU WELL.

<I>AGNES raises a basket of freshly cut flowers, trying to invoke his approval.</i>

> JUST GETTING SOME FOR MY NEXT ARRANGEMENT.

> THE STEMS ARE STRONGEST IN THE MORNING.

> I HAVE A SHOW COMING UP.

### KEVIN ###

> GOOD LUCK.

<I>The conversation hangs a moment. But AGNES can't stand the silence and breaks in with a quickly penned reply.</i>

### AGNES ###

> KEVIN, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING WELL.

> YOUR HEALTH SEEMS TO HAVE RETURNED.

> AND YOUR HAIR LOOKS WONDERFUL.

### KEVIN ###

> THANK YOU, AGNES. MONEY WAS NO OBJECT FOR MOTHER. I HAVE HER TO THANK.

### AGNES ### 

> SHE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL WOMAN.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE IS.

<I>The two men take the opportunity to allow AGNES to resume her cutting of the lilies. They step inside the stone door and it finally closes.</i>

<i>Once inside, KEVIN feels the necessity to disclose the background information.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MOM TOLD HER I HAD CANCER.

### CEDRIC ###

> SHE.... WHAT?!

### KEVIN ###

> ... IT WAS EASIER THAN THE TRUTH.

<I>They look at each other for a moment.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> WELL. THAT'S SOMETHING.

<I>Lurking behind the corner of a room is his father's acolyte, the red-haired GEORGE HENRY. He has a tendency toward over-formality, as a point of disarming fun.</i>

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> CONJURER. DAYWALKER.

<I>GEORGE HENRY is very, technically, older than KEVIN, but he does not intend to wield any ground.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> GOOD MORNING, HENRY.

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> I HEAR YOU AND THE MASTER ARE GOING ON A ROADTRIP. 

> EXCITED?

<I>CEDRIC pipes up.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> JOB'S GOTTA GET DONE.

### KEVIN ###

> JUST BE SURE YOU'RE WATCHING THE 'NET. WE'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS WE CAN.

> WHERE'S MY MOTHER?

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> IN THE BASEMENT, I BELIEVE.

<I>The pair go downstairs, leaving G.H. in the dining room.</i>

<i>In the basement, they find MYRTLE MARSCAPONE at one of the tucked away computer stations. She has headphones on but she has the music on so loud that they can hear the reverberations through the housing.</i>

<i>She is so absorbed in her focus that she doesn't notice their approach. KEVIN places his hand gently on her shoulder. </i>

<i>She jumps.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> KEVIN. MY GOD. YOU SCARED ME.

### KEVIN ###

> SORRY ABOUT THAT. 

<I>She places her hand over her heart in an attempt to calm the rush of adrenaline.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> YOU GET AROUND SO EASILY THESE DAYS.

<I>KEVIN says nothing.</i>

> I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR MYSELF.

<p class="ppl-sez">I hate this self-pitying habit she's developed.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> WE'RE TAKING THE VAN.

<I>MYRTLE pauses a moment, absorbing the information.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> DO YOU NEED MONEY FOR GAS? THING EATS GAS FOR BREAKFAST.

### KEVIN ###

> I'LL JUST USE MY CARD, BUT THANKS, MA.

<I>He turns toward CEDRIC and lifts a set of keys from his pocket.</I>

> CAN YOU GIVE THESE TO G.H.?

### CEDRIC ###

> SURE THING.

<I>CEDRIC leaves the mother and son and goes upstairs.</i>

<i>A silence, an awkwardness, fills the room.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> YOUR FATHER WAS A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

<div class="chat-box">

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Oh here she goes.</p>
</div>

### MYRTLE ###

> HE GOT IN A TERRIBLE -- HE'D GET TERRIBLE ROAD RAGE BEHIND THE WHEEL. ONLY GOT WORSE ON THE FREEWAY.

<I>KEVIN sorts over the words.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WELL THE ROADS WERE A BIT DIFFERENT WHEN HE LEARNED TO DRIVE.

### MYRTLE ###

> ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">I wasn't that bad.</p>
</div>

### MYRTLE ###

> I'VE GOT TO LOOK THROUGH THE HOUSE TODAY. I'VE REALLY NO IDEA WHERE TO START. NO IDEA WHAT'S MISSING.

> HOW COULD ANYONE HAVE STOLEN FROM ME? I'VE GOT MORE ALARMS THAN --

### KEVIN ###

> MAYBE IT'S FROM WITHIN.

### MYRTLE ###

> ONE OF MY STUDENTS?

<I>KEVIN shrugs.</i>

> WELL THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING.

### KEVIN ###

> I'M SURE IT WILL COME TO YOU.

### MYRTLE ### 

> I HATE LOOKING THROUGH MY FILES.

> IT BRINGS BACK SO MANY SAD MEMORIES.

<I>KEVIN's mother has been tending toward depression more and more these days.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> THERE ARE GOOD ONES TOO.

<I>But MYRTLE says nothing. As if giving up, she concedes defeat.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> WELL I'M SURE YOU'LL WANT TO BE GETTING ON THE ROAD.

<I>She's silent a moment, then quickly speaks.</i>

> CAN I GET YOU SOME BREAKFAST?

### KEVIN ###

> ... YEAH, MA. 

> I'D LIKE THAT.

<I>KEVIN has already eaten this morning but he is loathe to refuse his mother's offering.</i>

<i>They go upstairs. KEVIN lets his mother go first.</i>

<i>On the ground floor, CEDRIC is in the kitchen, looking out a window.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> I COULD MAKE YOU A GRILL CHEEZE.

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Oh here she goes.</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN takes a moment.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> I... CAN'T REALLY EAT THAT STUFF ANYMORE.

<I>...</I>

> IT'S SO GREASY. DOESN'T... SIT WELL WITH MY SYSTEM.

### MYRTLE ###

> OH...

> I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

<I>...</I>

> I... DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

### KEVIN ###

> IT'S NOT SINCE FOREVER. JUST LATELY.

> I'M GETTING OLDER.

### MYRTLE ###

> OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

<I>A torrent of rain starts to fall outside.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Well that's unfortunate.</p>
</div>

### MYRTLE ###

> WHAT CAN I GET YOU THEN?

<I>There is a hanging in the conversation.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE PROTEIN SHAKES?

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She wants to cook for you.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> I'M JUST... NOT VERY HUNGRY.

### MYRTLE ###

> JUST THE CHOCOLATE.

### KEVIN ###

> FINE WITH ME.

<I>MYRTLE opens the fridge and retreives a metallic can. She pops the tab and hands it to him.</i>

<div class="chat-box">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/tb/vincent-tb.jpg" class="chat-portrait" />
<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She didn't shake it.</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Goddamn it all.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> THANKS, MA.

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S REALLY COMING DOWN OUT THERE. THAT WAS FAST.

<I>MYRTLE changes her tone, quickly, addressing a different man of the house.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> (yelling) G.H.! DO YOU NEED ANY TEA?!

<I>And then, as if to speak silently and out of his earshot,</i>

> HE USES IT AS A MOUTHWASH.

<I>GEORGE HENRY walks into the kitchen. CEDRIC turns around to face him.</i>

### GEORGE HENRY ###

> NO TEA TODAY. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS.

<I>The kitchen is quiet.</i>

<i>CEDRIC addresses KEVIN.</I>

### CEDRIC ###

> WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WE GOTTA GET ON THE ROAD.

### MYRTLE ###

> HAVE A SAFE TRIP, BOYS.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The rain is still active when KEVIN, CEDRIC arrive at the STRAUD MANSION.</i>

<i>Sitting on the covered stoop is VLADISLAUS STRAUD.</I>

<I>There are no chairs; he sits on the floor, his feet on the stairs.</i>

<i>His front door is cracked open. Just slightly.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> GREETINGS.

### KEVIN ### 

> SALUTATIONS.

### CEDRIC ###

> YOU REALLY COMING WITH?

### STRAUD ###

> IT SEEMS.

<I>KEVIN walks up the stairs, steering clear of STRAUD's sitting place. He walks over to allow him berth.</i>

<i>CEDRIC walks over to the left side of the house.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">They're not in season yet.</p>
</div>

<i>KEVIN pushes open the heavy door and yells into the foyer.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> (yelling) MANDARC? YOU READY?

<I>In a short pause appears the young vampire, MANDARC. He runs, even in the house. He had been in the sitting room.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> MY APOLOGIES. I WAS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DUST THE FIREPLACES.

> I DON'T WANT ROXANNE TO LIFT A FINGER WHILE SHE'S HERE.

### KEVIN ###

> SOUNDS GOOD. YOU GOT ANY BAGS?

### MANDARC ###

> WELL. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M UNDECIDED.

> WHAT DO YOU THINK. SHOULD I BRING SOME OF THE FAST FOOD?

### KEVIN ###

> HAVE YOU ASKED STRAUD?

### MANDARC ###

> NO, NOT YET.

### KEVIN ###

> WELL, WE'RE NOT CROSSING ANY BORDERS BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE WE'LL GET SEARCHED.

### MANDARC ###

> THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

### KEVIN ###

> I'D SAY GO WITHOUT IT.

<I>...</I>

### MANDARC ###

> FOUR DAYS, HUH? 

<I>...</I>

> SHIT! I FORGOT. WE SHOULD BRING SOME DOG FOOD.

### KEVIN ###

> WE CAN.

> OR WE CAN JUST NAB WHATEVER THEY HAVE LEFT-OVER. THEY WON'T BE NEEDING IT. 

> LIGHTEN THEIR LOAD.

> BESIDES. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE BEEN FEEDING HIM THESE DAYS. DOG'S GONNA BE STRESSED OUT ENOUGH. WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE HIS FOOD UP ON HIM AS WELL.

### MANDARC ###

> MAKES SENSE MAKES SENSE. 

> I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.

### KEVIN ###

> YOU GOT ANY OF HIS OLD TOYS OR A BED OR SOMETHING?

### MANDARC ###

> OH... UH. ALL THAT STUFF IS AT THE OLD HOUSE.

### KEVIN ###

> AH. WELL IT'S FINE. 

> PROBABLY SMELLS MORE OF DUST THAN JOY.

> SO YOU READY TO GO?

### MANDARC ###

> I SUPPOSE SO.

<I>The pair shuffle out. When they step outside, STRAUD stands up and descends the steps. CEDRIC has rejoined the group.</i>

<i>KEVIN, CEDRIC ride in the front of the van. MANDARC takes the center and STRAUD climbs into the back bench. The car starts with a rumble and soon the STRAUD MANSION is shinking out of vision.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> SO CALEB'S BACK AT THEIR DAD'S HOUSE, HUH.

### MANDARC ###

> YEAH HE IS. HAVEN'T SEEN LILITH AROUND. I THINK THE TWO ARE STILL FIGHTING.

### CEDRIC ###

> QUARQ'S A GOOD GUY. I WISH HE'D JUST GET OVER HIMSELF.

### STRAUD ###

> HIS FATHER WAS THE SAME WAY. ALWAYS BROODING.

### MANDARC ###

> SO WHEN'D YOU GET THIS OLD CLUNKER, ANYWAY?

### KEVIN ###

> WELL. IT WAS ONE OF DAD'S LAST ACQUISITIONS.

> TO BE HONEST, SHE'S IN PRETTY ROUGH SHAPE BUT I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

### MANDARC ###

> NICE.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE'S WELL-INSULATED. REINFORCED.

### MANDARC ###

> NICE.

### KEVIN ###

> YEAH, DAD KNEW HIS WAY AROUND A CAR. CAN'T SAY I KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS BUT I'LL GET AROUND TO IT ONE OF THESE DAYS.

### MANDARC ###

> YEAH. I OUGHTA LEARN TO DRIVE.

### KEVIN ###

> IT'S NOT TOO HARD, JUST TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE. I COULD ALWAYS TAKE YOU OUT SOMETIME.

### MANDARC ###

> OH MAN. I'D BE SO NERVOUS.

### CEDRIC ###

> WE'LL SIGN YOU UP FOR DRIVING SCHOOL.

<I>MANDARC makes an emission that's somewhere inbetween a tut and a scoff.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU DID?

<I>After a pause, he speaks.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH. IT IS.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The ride continues in near-silence for a while. They decide on an oldies station but the signal is beginning to fade the further they get from the city.</i>

<i>The van has curtains over each of the passenger windows. MANDARC periodically stares out of his. STRAUD has his covered.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> JUST F.Y.I. -- IF WE CAN DO IT, I WASN'T GOING TO STOP UNTIL STRIXHAVEN.

### MANDARC ###

> CAN'T YOU POP A POTION OR SOMETHING?

### KEVIN ###

> EH. MAKES ME A LITTLE JITTERY.

### MANDARC ###

> FRIDAY USED TO POP THAT SHIT LIKE CANDY.

### CEDRIC ###

> THAT'S BEEN WORKING REAL WELL FOR HER.

### KEVIN ###

> YEAH. I DRIVE BEST WITH ACTUAL REST.

### MANDARC ###

> WHERE'S THIS PLACE WE'RE GOING? STRIXHAVEN?

### KEVIN ###

> IT'S A SAFE PLACE. BUT WE'RE STILL A WAYS OUT.

### CEDRIC ###

> COLLEGE TOWN.

### MANDARC ###

> AND THEY... UH....

### STRAUD ###

> I KNOW A FRIEND WHO MIGHT BE THERE.

</div>

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The drive continues quiet, uneventful. But everyone soon becomes aware of the increasing frequency with which MANDARC is shifting, uncomfortable, in his seat.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> GUYS. 

> I'M TRYIN' BUT... I THINK I GOTTA TAKE A PISS.

### CEDRIC ###

> SERIOUSLY? IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO HOURS.

### MANDARC ###

> I AM AWARE; I'M JUST... ANXIOUS.

### CEDRIC ###

> CAN'T YOU HOLD IT?

<I>MANDARC says nothing.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> I'M JUST NOT USED TO BEING IN THE CAR THIS LONG.

<I>KEVIN tries to calm the growing heat.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> WE STILL HAVE A WAY TO GO. I CAN STOP AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE... --

### CEDRIC ###

> DIDN'T YOU BRING ANY JUICE BOXES?

### MANDARC ###

> I... UH...

### KEVIN ###

> I ADVISED AGAINST IT. JUST IN CASE WE GOT STOPPED.

### CEDRIC ###

> I COULDA TALKED US OUT OF A PROBLEM.

### KEVIN ###

> I JUST THOUGHT IT BEST TO NOT TAKE ANY RISKS.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, WELL, HERE WE GO.

### STRAUD ###

> STOP AT A GROCERY STORE. NOT THIS TOWN. THE NEXT ONE.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The group leave the highway at a subsequent junction. The town is modest, but quiet. Cars hustle about on their business.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> UGH. THE SUN HAS COME OUT.

### CEDRIC ###

> COULDA STAYED IN THE CAR, BUT NO...

<I>STRAUD is immune to the impending bickering.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> DO NOT PIERCE THE SKIN. LEAVE NO TRACE. DO AS I'VE TAUGHT YOU.

### MANDARC ###

> WILL DO.

<I>Outside the store are wooden-walled displays of colorful fruits and vegetables. The automated door whirrs open to allow entrance to the party of four. Inside, metal shopping carts rattle and clash against each other. Some recent billboard's pop tune plays over the loudspeaker.</i>

<i>STRAUD pulls his collar tight against his neck.</i>

<i>KEVIN lifts a shopping basket from its stack.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> SUPPLIES. FOR THE ROAD.

> YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?

### CEDRIC ###

> I'LL GRAB SOME CHEWING GUM.

<I>They approach the beverage aisle. Fortunately for them, there is a man of middle-age restocking drinks into the chilled recess.</i>

<i>MANDARC, clothed in his fur-lined jacket, approaches the man.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> EXCUSE ME, SIR. WHERE IS YOUR BATHROOM?

<I>The man is reserved.</i>

### MAN ###

> SORRY. IT'S ONLY FOR EMPLOYEES.

<I>The group look each other quizzically. They make quite the strange group. So much for incognito.</i>

<i>Suddenly, STRAUD speaks up.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> MY SON SUFFERS FROM...

> IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME.

> IT'S... AN INHERITED TRAIT.

<I>MANDARC smiles awkwardly.</i>

<i>The man groans in irritation but relents. He points toward the rear of the store.</i>

### MAN ###

> BEHIND THE BUTCHER. FOLLOW STRAIGHT BACK, IT'S ON THE LEFT.

### STRAUD ###

> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

### MAN ###

> YEAH YEAH.

<I>The man resumes restocking the single-serve cartons. MANDARC, STRAUD leave, headed for the back of the store.</i>

<I>KEVIN walks toward the front.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> I WASN'T JOKING; I ACTUALLY AM GOING TO BUY SOMETHING.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>In a few minutes, CEDRIC, KEVIN meander back toward the butcher counter. The red seems to glow; it's hard to put it out of mind.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> SO. THE MISSUS ACTUALLY TOLD AGNES YOU HAD CANCER.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE JUST TOLD HER. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME SHE'S USED THAT PARTICULAR EXCUSE. 

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S JUST...

### KEVIN ###

> IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. BETTER TO STAY UNDER THE RADAR.

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S INSULTING. IS THAT WHAT SHE REALLY THINKS?

### KEVIN ###

> I DOUBT IT. IT JUST MAKES PEOPLE STOP TALKING.

### CEDRIC ###

> I DON'T LIKE IT.

### KEVIN ###

> NO.

<I>...</I>

> MY FATHER PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE EITHER.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH.

### KEVIN ###

> SHE'S BEEN SUCH A HEADACHE LATELY.

### CEDRIC ###

> YOU'RE TELLING ME. YOU DON'T LIVE NEXT TO HER. 

> SHE THINKS WE'RE LIVING IN ONE GIANT EPISODE OF THE SOPRANOS.

### KEVIN ###

> HAHA. SHE DOES, DOESN'T SHE.

<I>Emerging from the back hallway, pushing a curtain of clear plastic flaps aside comes STRAUD, MANDARC.</I>

### STRAUD ###

> 'MY SON'... HAS RELIEVED HIMSELF.

> ARE WE JUST ABOUT DONE WITH THIS EXCURSION?

> 'DETOUR'?

<I>MANDARC looks over the display of meats.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> YEAH. I JUST HAVE TO CHECK OUT.

### STRAUD ###

> LET'S GO, THEN. I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ALL I CAN TAKE OF THIS--

### CEDRIC ###

> PODUNK TOWN?

### STRAUD ###

> INDEED.
