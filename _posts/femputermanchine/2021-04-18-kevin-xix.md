<i>The drive from FutureSim to Queens is mostly uneventful. A few nutsos but nothing out of the ordinary. Finally, he reaches his destination.</i>

<i>A familiar face hangs down the upper landing.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> KEV.

> DON'T BOTHER TAKING OFF YOUR SHOES; WE GOTTA GET THE VAN.

### KEVIN ###

> I FIGURED AS MUCH.

<I>CEDRIC comes downstairs and slips his shoes back on.</i>

<i>Once they are outside, CEDRIC spills the beans.</i>

<i>The weather is calm and sunny.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> IT'S ONE OF OUR DEARLY DEPARTED CLASSMATES. 

> LARRY.

### KEVIN ###

> POTTER? WHAT'S HE NEED?

### CEDRIC ###

> HIS LITTLE GIRLFRIEND HAS GONE M.I.A.

### KEVIN ###

> HERMIONE?

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH.

### KEVIN ###

> MOM SAID YOU GUYS SCRYED FOR HER?

<I>CEDRIC smooths his hair.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH AND NO DICE.

<I>KEVIN sighs, but tries to restrain his disappointment.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> NOT TERRIBLY SURPRISING IF ALL YOU HAD TO GO BY WAS THE YEARBOOK.

<I>KEVIN unlocks the gate to the driveway of the left units.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> KEYS TO THE MONSTROSITY ARE INSIDE?

<I>KEVIN, of course, refers to a large, black, high-walled van owned by the MARSCAPONES.</I>

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, HANGING ON THE PEG.

### KEVIN ###

> AIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

<I>KEVIN goes in the side entrance of the complex, nabs the keys from the nearby hook, and returns to the outdoors. On the ring is an oversized barcode fob for the local pet store.</i>

<i>He raises his hand with his own set of keys in hand. CEDRIC reaches forward to receive the intended drop. It lands, secure.</i>

<i>The pair perform a sort of round-robin wherein KEVIN runs the van out of the driveway and CEDRIC replaces it with KEVIN's teal jalopy. CEDRIC relocks the door to the driveway and meets KEVIN in front of the MARSCAPONE HOUSE, where he's parked the dark van. KEVIN passes the keys back to KEVIN.</I>

### CEDRIC ###

> YOU OKAY DRIVIN' THIS THING?

### KEVIN ###

> LIKE BUTTER.

<I>He laughs lightly, almost a scoff.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> TO EACH HIS OWN.

<I>They reenter the house. The entry is quiet; it's not immediately apparent where the guests are.</i>

<i>KEVIN speaks quietly, for only CEDRIC to hear.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> SO. 

> POTTER, HUH.

### CEDRIC ###

> YEAH, POTTER.

### KEVIN ###

> WHAT'S HE UP TO THESE DAYS?

### CEDRIC ###

> I DON'T KNOW. DIDN'T ASK.

### KEVIN ###

> WHERE'S G.H.?

### CEDRIC ###

> SLEEPIN'. LIKE A FOOL.

### KEVIN ###

> COULD YOU DO THE HONORS?

### CEDRIC ###

> MY PLEASURE.

<I>CEDRIC leaves and heads to the basement. It is up to KEVIN to find his mother and her guest.</i>

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">She always loved the library.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> (thinking) But I don't hear any noise from the landing.

<i>KEVIN goes up to the second floor but no one is around. The record player echoes some sort of pop melody.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MOTHER! WHERE ARE YOU?

<I>But there is no response.</i>

<i>He ascends to the third floor, quietly, slowly, carefully.</i>

<i>There is his mother, trolling the (w)IntraNet. Lurking.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MOTHER?

<I>She jumps and looks toward his voice.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> KEVIN! HELLO!

<I>His expression calms.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> EY, MA.

<I>She double-checks the computer screen.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> YOU MADE GOOD TIME, DIDN'T YOU?

<I>KEVIN laughs a bit, shrugs.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> YOU KNOW ME: ALWAYS SPEEDING.

### MYRTLE ###

> WELL YOU ALWAYS KEEP SAFE. 

> GOOD, GOOD, GLAD TO SEE YOU.

### KEVIN ###

> WHERE'S LARRY?

### MYRTLE ###

> OH GEEZ, I LOST TRACK OF HIM. YOU SURE HE'S NOT IN THE LIBRARY?

### KEVIN ###

> I JUST PASSED THROUGH...

### MYRTLE ### 

> RIGHT. 

> WELL LET'S GO FIND THE LITTLE BUGGER.

<I>The pair descend the stairs. KEVIN lets his mother go first. When she gets to the bottom of the stairs, she looks about.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> NO, CERTAINLY NOT HERE.

<I>They pass through two more floors until they are in the basement. LARRY is there, at a computer station, browsing a popular forum-style website on the Internet.</i>

<i>He hears the two step into the lair and looks around to greet them.</i>

### LARRY ###

> ...KEVIN.... HI.

### KEVIN ###

> LARRY. SALUTATIONS.

### LARRY ###

> (awkward) AND... SAME TO YOU.

<I>The conversation hangs for a moment until MYRTLE breaks the silence.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> LARRY IS TRYING TO LOCATE HIS CLASSMATE.

### KEVIN ###

> HERMIONE.

### LARRY ###

> YES.

### KEVIN ###

> CEDRIC TOLD ME.

> LISTEN. WE GOTTA GET ON THE ROAD IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT IN ANY DECENT TIME.

### LARRY ###

> YOU'RE WORKING AT FUTURESIM?

### KEVIN ###

> (with pause) FOR NOW.

### LARRY ###

> WE'RE SEEKING THE SERVICES OF A HOLY MAN?

### KEVIN ###

> IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

<I>CEDRIC comes out of the doorway at the end of the hallway.</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> G.H. IS GETTING AROUND. HE'LL BE OUT IN A FEW.

<I>MYRTLE desires to provide additional background to the uninformed.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> (to LARRY) LARRY, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. AN ASSOCIATE OF MY LATE HUSBAND WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND THE SÉANCE.

### KEVIN ###

> CAR SEATS SEVEN COMFORTABLY SO WE SHOULD BE FINE.

> (to LARRY) WHEN'S THE LAST YOU HEARD FROM HERMIONE?

### LARRY ###

> FEW YEARS AGO WE MET UP FOR COFFEE IN THE CITY.

### KEVIN ###

> THAT'S NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">Certainly not.</p>
</div>

### KEVIN ###

> WELL, WE'LL WORK WITH IT. WE'RE GOING TO VISIT THE VAMPIRE VLADISLAUS STRAUD.

### LARRY ###

> STRAUD?

### CEDRIC ###

> VLADISLAUS STRAUD. COUNT. THE FOURTH.

<I>LARRY seems unnerved.</i>

### LARRY ###

> ...THIS NEARBY?

### KEVIN ###

> THE COUNT LIVES IN JAMAICA ESTATES.

### CEDRIC ###

> AND THANK GOD YOU AIN'T DRIVIN'.

<I>LARRY flashes an indignant look at CEDRIC.</I>

### MYRTLE ###

> WHY DON'T WE ALL GET IN THE CAR? I'M SURE G.H. WILL BE READY MOMENTARILY.

<I>LARRY, MYRTLE head upstairs. CEDRIC, KEVIN stand in the basement, wordless for a few moments.</i>

<i>GEORGE HENRY emerges from his sanctuary. He is clad in a jacket and dockers. His orange hair is tied into a bun.</i>

### G.H. ###

> (to KEVIN, bowing) CONJURER.

> STRAUD'S?

### CEDRIC ###

> YEP.

### G.H. ###

> OKEE DOKIE.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>In the car are five people. KEVIN drives, CEDRIC rides shotgun. MYRTLE takes the middle bench by her lonesome. LARRY, G.H. sit as far as possible from each other in the backseat.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> ANYONE HAVE ANY REQUESTS FOR THE RADIO? 

> IT'S NOT A SHORT RIDE.

<I>The car is silent, each contemplating his own dilemma.</i>

<i>After a moment of indecision,</i>

### CEDRIC ###

> JUST PUT IT ON THE ALTERNATIVE TRASH.

<I>but G.H. pipes up.</i>

### G.H. ###

> THEY PLAY TOO MANY COMMERCIALS. 

> 'TWO MINUTE PROMISE', MY ASS.

<p class="ppl-sez">VINCENT//</p>
<p class="ppl-sez">He's not wrong.</p>
</div>

<i>The car is silent for a few choice moments before LARRY speaks up.</i>

### LARRY ###

> MY PHONE'S GOT BLUETOOTH.

### KEVIN ###

> GO AHEAD. I'LL KEY YOU IN FROM UP HERE.

<I>The group proceeds to listen to a procession of girl bands while they move across Queens.</i>

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>When they reach the STRAUD MANSION, the sun is threatening to set in the sky. The huge stone structure stands monolithic against the impending sunset.</i>

<i>KEVIN drives up the carpark and secures the vehicle just barely catty-corner. The engine goes to silence, begging the passengers to exit the van.</i>

<center>SLAM.</center>

<center>SLAM.</center>

<center>...SLAM.</center>

<i>And soon the five are collected outside the dark, high-walled van.</i>

<i>KEVIN is the first to approach the door. He knocks. A moment passes. MYRTLE, LARRY, G.H. still collected, scattered about the carpark.</i>

<i>A young man with pale skin and a tossle of dark hair answers the door.</i>

### KEVIN ###

> MANDARC. GREETINGS. WE'RE HERE TO SEE THE MASTER.

### MANDARC ###

> HE'S AVAILABLE. ALLOW ME A MOMENT TO FETCH HIM.

> PLEASE, COME IN.

<I>The inside of the mansion is darkly colored and severe. Stone gargoyles line the entrance. MANDARC has disappeared. The party of five stands awkwardly in the entrance.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> WELL. IT'S ABOUT DINNER-TIME AND I DOUBT MY GOOD FRIEND HAS A TURKEY PREPARED.

> PLEASE, POTTER, COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND I'LL FIX A LITTLE RESPITE FOR US.

<I>LARRY is cautious. CEDRIC has left the foyer and sits at the pipe organ in the parlor. KEVIN takes up the place to his right, at a far more modern piano.</i>

<i>MYRTLE goes into the dining room and prepare to summon a feast at the table.</i>

<I>She raises her hands and waves them about, tiny sparks flying about as she recites the words.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> OUR FATHER, WHICH ART IN HEAVEN.

> HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

> GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES.

> FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER AND EVER.

> AMEN.

<I>As she completes the prayer, she flicks her wrist and all the makings of a fine dinner clutter the table.</i>

<i>CEDRIC soon joins the party, leaning up against the doorway, arms crossed, watching LARRY, MYRTLE enjoy the feast.</i>

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>They have just finished eating to satiation when the smell of wet tar fills the air. KEVIN gets up from the piano.</i>

<i>STRAUD materializes in the doorway.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> WELCOME TO MY ABODE.

<I>LARRY still has a face full of food, desperately trying to swallow when he sees he's being greeted.</i>

<i>MYRTLE takes it upon herself to try to help him out.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> (gesturing) MY STUDENT, LARRY POTTER.

<I>He struggles to quickly chew his food and down a gulp of water -- </i>

### CEDRIC ###

> MY... CLASSMATE.

<I>LARRY collects himself.</i>

### LARRY ###

> WELL YOU WERE A FEW YEARS AHEAD OF ME, UPPERCLASSMAN.

### CEDRIC ###

> INDEED.

<I>No one seems to have taken notice of the silent entrance of the house's butler.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> MY MASTER HEARS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS FROM THE GREAT BEYOND.

<I>He stands behind the freshly recomposed Elder. KEVIN soon follows, standing behind them, but in earshot, in the hallway.</i>

### LARRY ###

> YES... MY FRIEND HAS GONE MISSING.

### MYRTLE ###

> (interrupting) A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE, THE YOUNG HERMIONE GRANGER.

### STRAUD ###

> HERMIONE... 'GRANGER'.

<I>As if to try to qualify the information, MYRTLE speaks with surprising vigor.</i>

### MYRTLE ###

> SHE WAS A STUDENT OF MINE, JUST A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN LARRY HERE.

> HER PARENTAGE WAS NON-MAGICAL, AN ORPHAN, LIKE SO MANY OF MINE.

### CEDRIC ###

> 'I' SUSPECT SHE'S MUDDLED IN MAGICS BEYOND HER UNDERSTANDING.

### STRAUD ###

> KEVIN?

### KEVIN ###

> WELL, SIR. I CAN'T SAY I WAS TOO CLOSE WITH THE YOUNG WITCH BUT SHE WAS INDEED ONE OF MY MOTHER'S STUDENTS.

> AS FOR HER GENERAL APPROACH, QUITE HONESTLY I CANNOT COMMENT.

> BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO ME.

### STRAUD ###

> VERY WELL.

> YOU WANT TO KNOW IF SHE YET LIVES?

### CEDRIC ###

> OR IF SHE'S CAUGHT ON SOME DISTANT PLANE

### STRAUD ###

> SHE WAS A PLANESWALKER?

### MYRTLE ###

> NOT HABITUALLY. BUT I DO THINK SHE WAS MORE THAN CAPABLE.

### MANDARC ###

> SHALL I SET UP THE TABLE, PROFESSOR?

### STRAUD ###

> INDEED.

> WE'LL NEED TWO ADDITIONAL CHAIRS.

> NO. THREE.

### MANDARC ###

> THREE, SIR?

<I>STRAUD pauses and looks toward the young vampire, looking him up and down.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> YES, MANDARC. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TO BE IN ATTENDANCE.

### MANDARC ###

> UH... SIR...

### STRAUD ###

> IF CEDRIC CAN SIT THROUGH THIS SCHLOCK, SURELY YOU CAN MANAGE IT.

<I>Embarrassed, MANDARC acquieses. He disappears.</i>

<i>STRAUD turns toward the remaining in attendance.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> YOU DO REALIZE THAT IF I SPEAK TO MY GODS THAT I AM TALKING TO MY GODS.

> NOT YOURS.

> THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE VERITY OF THE DIVINATION BUT IT DOES COLOR THE RESPONSE.

### MYRTLE ###

> WE TRIED TO SCRY FOR ANSWERS IN MY REALM. BUT WE RECEIVED NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER.

### STRAUD ###

> AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU CONDUCT THIS RITUAL?

### LARRY ###

> YES, SIR! 

> IT IS!

<I>The party focuses their attention upon the young upstart.</i>

> MY FRIEND IS MISSING!

<I>STRAUD's demeanor toward the young wizard is kindly, if somewhat pandering.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> AND I ASSUME YOUR LETTERS HAVE GONE UNANSWERED?

<I>LARRY goes silent, embarrassed.</i>

### LARRY ###

> YES... SIR.

<I>STRAUD takes pause, looking at each of his guests.</i>

<i>Then he turns a gaze of disgust upon the bird's corpse neatly garnished upon his table. He sneers.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> WE'LL BEGIN THE RITUAL SHORTLY AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR EVENING REPAST.

<I>The moments pass by agonizingly. STRAUD retreats into his parlor. Finally MYRTLE, LARRY, KEVIN clean the table.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> I HOPE EVERYONE IS SATIATED.

> MY MAN HAS PREPARED THE RITUAL SPACE. BUT LET US ALLOW FOR A BIT OF A DIGESTIF.

### KEVIN ###

> (to LARRY) THE PROFESSOR COMMONLY PREFERS A MOMENT OF MUSIC POST-DINNER.

<I>He looks around at the room and notes a violin sitting upon a stand next to a plush couch.</i>

### LARRY ###

> (to KEVIN, quietly) I... UH... DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY.

### STRAUD ###

> THEN YOU WILL PERMIT YOURSELF TO BE ENTERTAINED BY ME AND MY FRIENDS.

<center>~ ~ ~</center>

<i>The sun is just setting when the music-making concludes. STRAUD gets up from his seat at the parlor's pipe organ.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> MANDARC HAS BEEN WAITING LONG ENOUGH FOR US. I SUGGEST WE RETIRE TO THE OBSERVATORY.

<I>The six slowly file upstairs, past the floor of bedrooms.</i>

<i>On the third floor is a small table with a crystal sphere set in its center. MANDARC stands off to one side, attempting to play steward to the guests.</i>

<i>The table is dwarfed by the seven chair clamoured around it. The primary four all match, but two folding chairs and a strange wooden chair make the contrast.</i>

### STRAUD ###

> IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF A TIGHT SQUEEZE, BUT I THINK WE CAN FIT SEVEN AROUND THE TABLE.

### MANDARC ###

> SIR?

### STRAUD ###

> YES, MANDARC?

<I>As if he's put his foot in his mouth, he's reserved.</i>

### MANDARC ###

> OH, UH... NOTHING, SIR.

<I>The seven file in toward the chairs. STRAUD stands while the rest find their seat.</i>

<i>KEVIN is the first to sit. CEDRIC, MYRTLE follow quickly after. GEORGE HENRY takes one of the folding chairs, as does LARRY POTTER.</I>

<I>MANDARC takes the back of a chair in his hands and stands until his Master approaches the dais.</i>
