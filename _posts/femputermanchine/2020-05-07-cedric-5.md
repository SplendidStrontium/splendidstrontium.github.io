Dear Cedric --
```

```
I'm sorry if this comes as a surprise to you. 
```

```
I usually foul these sorts of things up. My apologies in advance. 
```

```
I do usually think that one should not try to contact another unless they have made specific arrangements to do so. So I apologize for violating that code of conduct.

```
I hope you can empathize with such youthful optimism. 
```

```

```

```
And finally, to the reason I am writing you... 
```

```
I don't know if you remember, but there were the three of us that cast the spell that night, namely myself, Larry, and his friend, Ron. 
```

```
Ron is Larry's classmate and I thought he could complete the ritual with us and obv. it was come true 'cause you're still here but... Ron is really sick. Ever since we ...
