## JANEWAY SEZ ##
_Captain's log, stardate 48734.2. Sometimes it's a good idea to get away from being a Captain for a while. To that end, I've started participating in a new holonovel. The setting is ancient England._

## DISCLAIMERS TO THE AFFIXED TIMELINE ##
_As Captain, I reserve the right to change, amend, edit, or otherwise fool around with the dates and data provided here. I wrote this trying to get the approximate spacing correct and less to be completely accurate on dates. 1900 could turn into 1898 or whatever. Oh, and I will undoubtedly make some mistakes and mix things up. But I will also get a few things right. Thx for stickin' wit me._

_I performed some preliminary bookkeeping to graft some of the loners into the timeline. Notes on changes are affixed to the end of this timeline document. Notes only really matter if you were reading pre-2020... But if you're interested in pr realfact, then take a look._
