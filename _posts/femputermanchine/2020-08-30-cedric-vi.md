SETTING: 'Marscapone Apartments', Neucrest<br/>
YEAR: 2020, summer

<center>~</center>

CEDRIC rises from his nightly meditation. He is in a dark basement; the simple coffin of dark jungle wood is one of the few features of the cavern.

The young blond man wears a frown. He's had an unpleasant dream. He has no hesitation and begins talking to himself.

```
CEDRIC 

THE CAR... ALWAYS WITH THE CAR... ALWAYS LOSING IT.
```

His nightmare again had him as a steward of the family car -- which he lost due to his own neglectful assumptions.

In the dream, he'd been at a convention center meeting with an old schoolmate. Someone he'd known of, but, had they ever spoken?

```
CEDRIC

WHY HIM? WE WEREN'T EVEN FRIENDS.
```

CEDRIC seems preoccupied and begins pacing about the space. There is a simple computer on a desk in the corner -- it is a beige plastic reminiscent of at least twenty years prior. 

```
CEDRIC

WHY HIM, VINCE? WHY HIM?!
``` 

CEDRIC allows a moment of silence after he yells into the air. The world of Dream - Elysion - does not show itself trivially to the dreamer. Nor does its Prince, the elder Marscapone, act on whim to his disciples.

CEDRIC buries his fingers in his light hair and crumples to the ground in dry tears. In the distance, a bird's tinny melody silences the crickets.
