## SCROLL THROUGH EMAIL ##

```
Cedric,
    
I'm sorry if this comes as a surprise to you--
```

<I>at that moment, the door bursts open, and there's a face CEDRIC has never seen before. UNKNOWN INTRUDER slaps the cellphone from CEDRIC's hands. CEDRIC opens his mouth in anger.</I>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

Stop. Don't get that way with me.
```

<i>His voice of authority cools CEDRIC's anger.</i>

<i>CEDRIC keeps his eyes on the intruder, trying to glare at him as menacingly as possible. He reaches toward the cellphone, but is suddenly pushed off his feet by a dark wind.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

I'm done trying to reason with you Cedric. We've gone over this before, and if you won't go by persuasion, and trust me, I've tried, then we're going by force.
```

<i>CEDRIC continues to keep his eye on the man.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

Cedric, just calm down. Before you do anything rash, please just listen to me. 
```

<i>CEDRIC looks at the cellphone.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

There is no such thing as magic.
```

<i>CEDRIC growls.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

CEDRIC, SAY THE WORDS.
```

<I>CEDRIC winces again.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

CEDRIC, SAY THE WORDS. SAY IT!
```

```
CEDRIC

...
```

<i>The UNKNOWN INTRUDER unleashes an unseen heat into the room, ruffling the few fabrics left after years of disuse.</i>

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

Cedric, if you will not say the words, then we cannot continue with the day.
```

```
CEDRIC

(sigh)

There is no such thing --
````

```
UNKNOWN INTRUDER

--as magic. Thank you.
```
