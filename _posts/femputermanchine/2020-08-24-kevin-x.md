Cassandra is sitting alone in her house. She looks at her phone nervously. Once, twice, and then again. 

When it finally rings, she jumps.

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE

HEY, I'M OUTSIDE.
```

```
CASSANDRA GOTH 

OK OMW.
```

Her hands are shaking when she leaves her first floor bedroom to attend to the front door. KEVIN is dressed in a suit. His pant-legs are damp and icy.

She blocks the door and doesn't allow him to enter the premise. KEVIN backs away, sensing her tense mood. 

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE 

IT'S NICE TONIGHT, ENJOYING THE AIR.
```

```
CASSANDRA GOTH  

(pause) YEAH.
```

KEVIN looks around strangely.

```
CASSANDRA GOTH  

(with sudden strength) SO. YOU LIED TO ME.
```

KEVIN looks at her and tenses his eyebrows. He is squinting painfully with the reflective snow.

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE 

I... DIDN'--
```

```
CASSANDRA GOTH 

YOU'RE A FUCKING VAMPIRE! YOU FUCKED ME WHEN I WAS SLEEPING, YOU FED ON ME, I DON'T EVEN --
```

KEVIN is alarmed at the accusation but maintains a guilty stance.

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE

I NEVER FED ON YOU CASSANDRA.
```

```
CASSANDRA GOTH 

BULLSHIT~!
```

CASSANDRA begins to tear up and cry.

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE

I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM. PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.
```

```
CASSANDRA GOTH 

(defiant) WHAT, SO YOU CAN CONTINUE THE LIE?
```

```
KEVIN MARSCAPONE

I USED TO FEED ON BLOOD, YES, I FELT POWER FLOW THROUGH ME WHEN I CONSUMED THE DREAMS OF OTHERS... BUT I GAVE IT UP. I GAVE IT UP. I AM NO LONGER... THAT WHICH I WAS.
```

CASSANDRA GOTH, violently crying, runs in the house and slams the door.
