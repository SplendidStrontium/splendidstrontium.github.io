<i>KEVIN, QUARQ are sitting at a chess table alternating plays. The studio apartment has been fitted into a small bar. Large windows would look outside, but they're coated in ice and snow.</i>

<i>KEVIN, QUARQ talk to each other and CEDRIC is painting in the background. They both seem to be very absorbed in their current tasks.</i>

```
KEVIN
