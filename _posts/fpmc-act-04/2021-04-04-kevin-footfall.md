## // MARSCAPONE SUMMER HOME // ##

<I>The day of the week is Sunday. The usual day of the week for MYRTLE MARSCAPONE's grand feast.</i>

<i>Today, KEVIN MARSCAPONE prepares to rise from bed. His back aches, as it usually did after a night of sleep. And yet, he did not long for the coffin he once took peace in.</i>

<i>No, that life had denied him any possibility of peace.</i>

<i>It's early, but it barely seems it. The spring has brought with it the light of the Sun.</i>

<i>He rolls over, trying to ease the pain in his back's curvature. But it provides little relief. He's in a foul mood.</i>

#### KEVIN 

> PLEASE, FATHER. WAS THAT YOUR MEMORY? MOTHER AND YOU ALONE ON A CRUISE SHIP?

<br><I>KEVIN has had an unpleasant dream.</i>

<br><i>KEVIN reaches up and pulls his hair back from his forehead. It's always been a source of irritation for him; he had started to notice thinning about the temples soon after his teenage years had neared their end.</i>

#### KEVIN

> I HAD SUSPECTED AS MUCH BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING MUCH MIND.

<br><I>Matters concerning vanity had been slipping from his concern. The fa√ßade a necessary evil, occasionally an inconvenience: a window to the emotional torrents within.</i>
