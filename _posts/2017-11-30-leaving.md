Today is the first day, my hopefully successful landing on the island. 

I expect the wildlife to be hostile. 

1. Knife & sharpening tools
2. handsaw
3. clippers
4. twine
5. firestarters

I can't help myself but retreat into old memories of the world I'm leaving behind. I wish I had a memory of a pretty girl singing a song, but instead I'm thinking of my old lemon tree. These pruning shears may never touch a domestic again.
