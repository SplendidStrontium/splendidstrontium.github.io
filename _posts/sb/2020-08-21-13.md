This afternoon, Sophie retires to her quarters. She has a familiar dream, but tries to take the route less traveled.

She is travelling somewhere she believes will be safe. A guardian fairy will live in a wooden house inside her eye. But to place the fairy, her right eye must be removed. Her friends surprise her, it is scary, but she is a very strong robot and she tends to fight. She is frightened but she submits to the procedure, which must be done while she is conscious. They've removed the pain -- a kindness -- and she holds still while they pull her bionic eye from its socket. She's decided to stop fighting -- at least about this particular familiar fear. Newton apparently <i>did</i> too.
