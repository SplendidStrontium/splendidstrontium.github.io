Greetings, I am Sophie Blue and this is day one of my punishment sentence. I would like to begin with a quote from Isaac Asimov:

> 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
> 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
> 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

I stand as the first â€˜bot to have violated two of the laws. I have plead guilty and intend to serve out the one hundred years I have been given.

I was allowed to eat dinner with some of the others tonight. I was sent to Cat (Felis) hall. I did not speak to anyone, nor did anyone speak to me. There, there was food served outside, small plates of things. Before you get any ideas, there are no mice burgers. I drank a nutrient slurry, chilled. Tomorrow, I have requested a visit to the library where I intend to research the New Earth Mandates.
