After years of writing in many different directions, I am ready to commit to a clear creative path. I pushed my first commit to this website ten years ago in 2015 and began publishing my writing here in 2019. Beginning in 2020 and concluding with its final post in January 2025, I worked primarily within my Femputer Machine (FPMC) universe, where I explored what it meant to survive in a world that was more than it appeared.

## nan.nyc Reorganization

In an effort to highlight my current projects, I have streamlined the organization of the website while maintaining access to historical content. The collection of my archived works can be found at https://nan.nyc/archive/. Although I may reorganize and modernize navigation within the content in the future, I intend to keep as much of it online as possible. 

I am committed to keeping my website simple. My design philosophy is inspired by the early days of the Internet, when the dream of the World Wide Web was to disseminate ideas more freely than had ever been done before. My platform is text-forward, and always will be. I will continue to move toward features the modern reader expects for ease of use, while staying true to my vision and dedication to the written word.

## Writing Journey Evolution

For some thirty years, my writing workflow remained somewhat stagnant. I always felt that the process of writing with a pen upon paper facilitated a thoughtfulness that brought forth clarity about the bigger picture. As I filled dozens of notebooks, I found myself sometimes eliminating entire sections I had believed so crucial during their conception. I spent more time typing and editing, slowly realizing my cursive represented a first draft. The time had come to bring my process into the twenty-first century.

While I still do some work in pen and paper, I have shifted primarily to a digital workspace. I am able to work without bringing notebooks with me, and I can almost always capture a moment of inspiration, whether at my desk or walking down a city street. Where I once recoiled from the impersonal nature of the computer and keyboard, I now find relief in how quickly I can transition from musing to material.

## The femputermanchine Era

The work I spent on my foundational universe was instrumental to shaping my ideas, themes, and style. Over the five years I worked on FPMC, usually with flurries of activity followed by months of neglect, I collected over 434,000 words. I will be the first to admit that not all of it is "high-quality", but it still marks a significant corpus of effort. 

As I began to focus on longer pieces in 2023 and explore in depth the experiences of the characters I had created or inherited, I began to refine my voice. Some of the pieces from Act VIII showcased these people in ways I had been unable to accomplish as a younger writer. I continued to strive for more, but I felt weighed down by what I had created in the early years. 

I did not want to erase history. I tried to create new, more coherent rules and plots, but dismissing the foundational material as feverdream did not feel entirely genuine. I began to realize that it was time to start anew, using FPMC as the basis for a new cohesive vision that would accomplish what I had aspired to put to word since I began to write for an audience.

## Current Focus

After a comprehensive review of FPMC, I decided to start from the beginning, unburdening myself of early explorations, and document the arduous process by which a child may transcend childhood and become an adult, and even, something more. 

The Convergent Eigenspace, currently expected to form an eight-book series, follows Cedric Kenyon over a timeframe spanning several decades after he sheds his birthname, makes his way to New York City, and begins to realize his place in society. Along the way he discovers a world of magic and mysticism that runs parallel to the reality he had accepted for the first nineteen years of his life. He grapples with how to accept his unique destiny, remain strong against villainy, and resist the allure of selfishness. Through his struggles, he learns that we are more than the sum of our parts; when united, we are more than we were divided.

## What to Expect Here

I will use my existing website as a springboard toward a showcase of my current creative work. On what was the fairly unexciting landing page for https://nan.nyc, I will post the latest news regarding my projects, including website development, workflow details, creative progress, and maybe the occasional retrospective. 

While the landing page will showcase all of the most recent posts, all material specifically pertaining to The Convergent Eigenspace will be highlighted at https://nan.nyc/tce/.  

## Looking Forward

Amidst a graveyard of archived projects, I am anxious to see TCE to its completion. Although 2025 marks the start of this series in earnest, I began sketching the prototype over five years ago on this very website. I am ready to spread my wings and learn how to fly. 

I will continue to post here with my progress. I hope to see you along for the ride.
