How empty and aimless is this place without children. I find myself glancing at the clock, knowing the seconds tick by. My favorite clock is an old circular one. They were a rarity even in the time of <span class="cn-txt">大姐</span> so I was doubly surprised to find one here. 

I have to stop watching the clock though. My internal timekeepers do a good job of doling out my energy reserves. Even better, the sky is rarely hidden. Waiting for the next bell to ring simply wears out my nerves.
