There once was a gal from Kentucky<br>
whose saves were awfully unlucky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;she faced a beholder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;he set her a smoulder<br>
and now her pants are quite mucky

There once was a dude from New York<br>
bad food ne'er sullied his fork<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;when asked 'bout his hobby<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;for beauty he did lobby<br>
it's too bad he married an orc

There once was a bot named Mark<br>
on my site his spam did park<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;a euro per tune<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;no charge for a Zune<br>
I'm too cheap to dance with a narc
