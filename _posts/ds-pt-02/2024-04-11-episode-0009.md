#### VICTORIA

> STRANGENESS THAT SEEMS TO REACH OUT AND TOUCH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING THAT LIVES WITHIN ITS WALLS.

> FOR THE PAST CAN BE A PRISON, NOT ONLY FOR ME, BUT FOR OTHERS. 
> 
> FOR ALL THOSE DRIVEN BY FEARS OF THE FUTURE.

<p>Bill Malloy is the first person we see in this episode, and he's making a call for Burke Devlin's room at the Collinsport Inn. But Burke hangs up on him, refusing his call for a visit.</p>

<p>He then shows up at Collinwood, insisting to E.S. that it's "a lot more important than cleaning a teapot!" Hah. Also, he calls E.S. by the nickname "Liz" making him possibly the first character in the show to do so. I would say it betrays the closeness that the two of them share.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-02.jpg" />

<p>He's brought over some contracts for "Liz" to sign. But surely that's not the only reason he's here. He lets his secretary Alice know that he'll be here for about a half-hour. That's call-forwarding for you.</p>

<p>Ah, so he is here to speak about Burke Devlin. But Carolyn interrupts them.</p>

#### CAROLYN

> HELLO BILL.
> 
> HOW ARE THINGS AT THE FISH FACTORY?

#### BILL 

> SWIMMING ALONG, PRINCESS, JUST SWIMMING ALONG.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-03.jpg" />

<p>Since the cat's out of the bag about Burke, Carolyn asks about him and Bill delivers the simple fact that she's met him already; he's the one who broke up the fight last night.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-04.jpg" />

<p>Carolyn couldn't be more pleased.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> I'VE BEEN HEARING NOTHING BUT BURKE DEVLIN'S NAME AROUND HERE FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.
>
> UNTIL IT'S UP TO HERE.
>
> BUT WITH ALL OF IT, THERE'S ONE THING NO ONE EVER MENTIONED.

#### BILL 

> WHAT'S THAT?

#### CAROLYN 

> HOW GOOD LOOKING HE IS!

#### BILL 

> OUT!
> 
> LIKE YOUR MOTHER SAYS.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-05.jpg" />

<p>The two discuss how much they'd like to see Carolyn leave the house. Bill seems to be on board with the supernatural dangers of Collinwood, and he's just as adamant as Elizabeth about Carolyn leaving the house.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth still won't admit there are ghosts at Collinwood.</p>

<p>Bill turns the topic back to the living danger of Burke.</p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> BURKE WENT TO PRISON BECAUSE HE COMMITTED A CRIME.

#### BILL 

> DID HE?

#### ELIZABETH 

> ... YES.

#### BILL 

> ARE YOU SAYING, YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF HIM?

#### ELIZABETH 

> YES. 

#### BILL

> LIZ, I LIKE YOU. 
> 
> I THINK YOU'RE THE GREATEST WOMAN ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH.

#### ELIZABETH 

> WHY?
> 
> BECAUSE I'M NOT AFRAID OF BURKE DEVLIN?

#### BILL 

> BECAUSE YOU PLANT YOUR FEET FIRM ON THE DECK WHEN A GALE BLOWS. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-06.jpg" />

#### BILL 

> BECAUSE YOU HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH AND DAMN THE DEVIL BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN SCARED.
> 
> WELL LIZ, WE'LL STOP 'EM. 
> 
> YOU AND ME. 
> 
> NO MATTER WHAT BURKE TRIES TO DO.

<p>Vicki is a leftie, huh?</p> 

<p>Carolyn knocks on the door and then bursts in, complaining about Vicki locking the door. Well, Carolyn, if you didn't think you owned the place, maybe I wouldn't have to!</p>

<p>She shares the history of Widows' Hill, stating that it's 100 ft. from the edge to the bottom, and that three people have killed themselves on the hill, first Josette, then two governesses. Gee, thanks Carolyn! I could have lived without that lovely piece of information.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-08.jpg" />

#### CAROLYN 

> JOE HASKELL WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY.
> 
> ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME.
>
> OH VICKI, I LOVE JOE, BUT AS SOON AS HE MENTIONS MARRIAGE, PANIC SETS IN.
> 
> I START TO SHAKE. 

#### VICTORIA 

> YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT MARRIAGE. 

#### CAROLYN 

> BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE, VICKI.
> 
> THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY AFRAID OF. 

<p>And then she gets in to the meat of why she's here.</p>

#### CAROLYN 

> TELL ME ABOUT BURKE DEVLIN.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-09.jpg" />

<p>Yeah, there's that face. Yeah, boy, Carolyn. You really love Joe Haskell while you're asking about Burke, the bad boy who's come to bring ruin to your family. Please, go on!</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-10.jpg" />

#### BILL 

> HE WAS A HUNGRY MAN TEN YEARS AGO, BEFORE ALL THE TROUBLE BEGAN.
>
> I THINK IF HE COULD HAVE, HE WOULD HAVE GRABBED THE WORLD TEN MINUTES AFTER HE WAS BORN.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-11.jpg" />

#### BILL 

> AND THE WAY I HAVE HIM FIGURED, UNTIL BURKE DEVLIN OWNS THE COLLINS FISHING FLEET, AND THE COLLINS CANNERY AND THE COLLINS HOUSE, HE'S GOING TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A POOR MAN.
> 
> AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE.

<p>A mysterious knock comes to the door, but no one's there. We all thought it was Burke, right? I know I did.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-12.jpg" />

#### ELIZABETH 

> THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, BILL. 
> 
> AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE TEACUPS WAS SHATTERED.

#### BILL

> WELL HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

#### ELIZABETH 

> POLTERGEIST OF COURSE.
> 
> EVIL, MISCHEIVOUS SPIRITS. 
> 
> COLLINWOOD IS FAMOUS FOR ITS GHOSTS, YOU KNOW.
> 
> EXCEPT THIS ONE IS NINE YEARS OLD AND IS NAMED DAVID.

<p>Oh man, throw your nephew under the bus! </p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-13.jpg" />

#### CAROLYN 

> OH VICKI.
> 
> YOU KNOW BURKE DEVLIN THREATENED TO PADDLE ME LAST NIGHT?
> 
> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS HIM UNTIL JUST A MINUTE AGO.
>
> I BET HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT TOO.

#### VICTORIA 

> THAT'S HARDLY A RECOMMENDATION.

#### CAROLYN 

> MAYBE NOT. 
> 
> BUT A MAN LIKE THAT IS WORTH A SECOND LOOK, DON'T YOU THINK?

<p>The rest of this episode drags on a little bit, with Elizabeth and Bill trying a ploy to get Carolyn out of town, but it falls flat on their face. Nothing is going to dissuade the "princess" from chasing after Burke Devlin.</p>

#### BILL 

> YOU'RE STUBBORN, PRINCESS.
> 
> STUBBORN AS YOUR MOTHER.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0009-14.jpg" />

<p>And as we all saw coming, Carolyn phones Burke Devlin and asks whether she could come up to see him. Oh boy, what she's getting into. Anyone notice that this dude literally has the word "devil" in his name? I mean come on! Overall a decent episode, and I'm coming to appreciate Bill Malloy a great deal. I don't know if they're trying to 'ship him and Liz but I wouldn't entirely be opposed.</p>

<p>★★★☆</p>
