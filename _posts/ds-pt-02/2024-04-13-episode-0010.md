<p>Episode 10 opens with a phone call from Roger and Elizabeth showing off some of her maternal instinct. Unfortunately we find out that David was involved with the teacup incident. But it's curious, he claims he didn't touch it, "they did". </p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> DAVID, THINGS DON'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.

#### DAVID 

> THEY DO HERE.
> 
> LOTS OF THINGS HAPPEN HERE.

<p>At the Collinsport Inn, Burke sets up a coy little scenario for Carolyn. He lets her into the hotel room (isn't this a little improper, especially for the sixties?) and she immediately surrenders the information that neither her uncle nor her mother know that she's here. She's as transparent as lace.</p>

<p>He offers some hospitality, asking, and I find the phrasing interesting, "What can you have? Sherry? Ginger ale?" She refuses and attempts to sit on the chair, but he redirects her to the sofa, where he's placed a letter.</p>

<p>"Why is my uncle so afraid of you?" she asks. And he laughs, in an exaggerated, ungenuine tone. But ultimately he refuses to answer, saying there's no reason why Roger should be so afraid of him.</p>

<p>I really dislike Carolyn in this scene, as she's just so obvious and childlike. She admits to Burke that she's read the letter, playing right into his hands. </p>

#### CAROLYN 

> TO THE DEATH OF THE MONSTER!

#### BURKE 

> TO THE DEATH OF THE MONSTER.

<p>The scene changes to see a monster in miniature; a toy robot that David is playing with. Certainly some would think of him as a monster. I feel badly for him, I really do. He's a neglected child who's lost his mother.</p>

<p>And to be honest, where is Victoria in this instant? Shouldn't she be looking after the boy? Has she already joined in on what is practically a sport in this household?</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0010-07.jpg" />

<p>Drinking, yes, that is certainly the sport of some of the denizens of Collinsport.</p>

#### ELIZABETH 

> YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH OF THAT, ROGER, LATELY.

#### ROGER 

> THAT'S A VERY PROPER SISTERLY REMARK, BUT I'M IN NO DANGER OF BECOMING AN ALCOHOLIC ON THE STRENGTH OF ONE DRINK.

<p>They continue talking, with David listening all the while, and Roger says he feels the only proper thing to do with David is to put him in an "institution". I don't suppose he means any ordinary boys' school.</p>

<p>But thankfully Elizabeth defends her nephew.</p>

<p>Roger finds his son having listened in on the entire conversation, and things get heated. David gets the last word, saying he hopes Burke Devlin "gets even with you!" You tell 'em, David.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0010-09.jpg" />

<p>Carolyn is still trying to charm the pants off Burke, but he's got bigger plans on the brain. She's easily fooled and we're all sitting here with our face in a our palm wishing she had a few more neurons to rub together.</p>

#### BURKE 

> I THINK IT'S TIME WE GOT BETTER ACQUAINTED.

<p>Oh my.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0010-11.jpg" />

<p>Back at Collinwood, David has stirred his aunt from her dream in the chair. He has something in his hand, but he won't let anyone see it. "Only a shell," he insists, and then runs off. I thought it was a frog.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ds-0010-12.jpg" />

<p>I will try to separate my irritation at Carolyn from my enjoyment of the episode and how well it was put together. I was glad to see the plot move forward and happy to see so many faces in this episode. Excited to see what happens next now that the monster is at Collinwood.</p>

<p>★★★☆</p>
