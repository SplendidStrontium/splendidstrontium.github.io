Cookie dough will be soft and delicate; don't be afraid to use a fair amount of powdered sugar to keep it cohesive. Dough has a high butter content and especially if you whipped some air into it (yay), then it will soften quickly. When you're ready to prepare it, set it to room temperature for a quick 15 min or so (temp depending on season) and cut it into small pieces and work with powdered sugar. Dough will fall as it cooks, we want a cookie that tends toward a tender scone.

These little guys should come right off the pan when they come out of the oven. Might have been a pinch overcooked but it's hard to say and varies according to your preference.
