![sugar cookie recipe]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/recipe-sugarcookie.jpg)

_This is the perfect recipe for use with cookie cutters. The powdered sugar will melt slightly, creating almost an icing to the cookie._

* sift together `3c (360g) AP flour`, `1t (6g) baking powder`, and `1t (6g) salt`
* place `2 sticks (1c) butter` and `1c (200g) sugar` in a mixer and beat until light in color
* to the sugar, add `1 egg` and `1T (15g) milk`
* gradually add flour with mixer at low speed
* beat until mixture pulls away from side of bowl
* divide in half, wrap in wax paper, refrigerate two hours
* using powdered sugar as a non-sticking agent, roll out cookie dough to 1/4" thick. 
* cut into shapes and bake `375Â°` for `7-9min` to desired doneness
