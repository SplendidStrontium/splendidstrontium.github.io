_This is my favorite version so far. Cooks up easily to the perfect balance of texture and flavor._

* soften `1.5 sticks (170g) butter`, either in the oven or in a warm kitchen
* cream with `1.25c (160g) sugar` and a `dollop of molasses`
* stir in `1t vanilla extract`
* mix with `2 eggs` warmed to room temperature
* by hand, thoroughly mix in `100g AP flour`
* by hand, gently mix in `170g AP flour`, `1t salt`, `1t b.soda`, `1t AC vinegar`
* stir in `1 bag (10oz) chocolate chips`
* scoop into cylindrical shape on plastic wrap and shape
* wrap in parchment as an outer layer
* refrigerate dough at least 2 hours
* bake at `375Â°` for `10-13min` to desired doneness
