## Fluffify me, Cap'n

* using a double-boiler or a microwave, melt `50g butter`
* remove butter from heat
* to liquified butter, add `41g granulated sugar` & `9g molasses` and dissolve as remaining heat allows
* stir in `2t vanilla` & `2 eggs` and set aside
* create soured milk: `1c cow milk`, `3/5c oatmilk`, `2T vinegar` and allow to sit ~5min
* add milk to butter/sugar and mix throughly (I use an electric mixer)
* add `124g AP flour`, blend until smooth
* add `6g b.s`, `6g salt`, `4g b.p`, `123g AP flour` and blend (gently) until smooth
* fry on a hot, oiled griddle or cast-iron skillet

## Observations

* As per image, center is a pinch moist, although moisture content is conducive to eating later in the day; pancakes are still quite good after a few hours of sitting out.
* As per image, some of the bubbles created from leavening are a little large. Small bubbles should be evenly distributed -- let's reduce leavening just slightly in next version.
* In past experiments, I have substituted a banana baby-food pouch for an egg. It worked out quite well and I will continue to try this as an occasional variation.
* Oatmilk may be able to substitute entirely for cow's milk but I am concerned about reducing the protein content as well as reducing the efficacy of the vinegar-milk.
* Pancake is very soft to the touch, 'like a kitty-cat', I was told.
