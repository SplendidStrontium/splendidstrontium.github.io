Enumerated here are media-streams I feel are worth your time to digest. I am not necessarily endorsing views presented by these authors, nor is every item 'required reading'. Simply put, everything on this list is something I found profound in some way and I'd like to share the love. Updates to come. (last updated: Mar 30, 2020)
