# WELCOME

Since 2020, I have been composing a novel about a group of goodly vampires trying to save the world from alien invasion. I use github-pages and jekyll to form the skeleton for the blog posts, which can be found at https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/

It all started with a game of Sims 4. 

# ABOUT ME

I was born in 1988 in Ohio. In 2006, I moved to NYC and life has never been the same.
