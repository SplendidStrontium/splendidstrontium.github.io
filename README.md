# WELCOME

From 2020-2025, I composed a fanfiction about a group of vampires trying to save the world from alien invasion. I use github-pages and jekyll to form the skeleton for the blog posts, which can be found at https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/

In 2025, I began work on the eight-book fantasy series The Convergent Eigenspace, beginning with Book 0: What Time Cannot Touch. For more information, find details at https://nan.nyc/tce/

General updates from the author will be posted at https://nan.nyc/
