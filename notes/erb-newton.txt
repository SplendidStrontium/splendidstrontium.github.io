EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY
JUNE 16, 2014

BILL NYE

VERSUS

SIR ISAAC NEWTON

BEGIN

//newton

of all the scientific minds in history
they put beaker in a bow tie up against me

i'm a master
i discovered gravity
i drop rhymes like they fallin from an apple tree
you're no match for me
you got a batch degree
i got a unit o Force named after me
you wanna battle guy
that's a crazy notion
when i start flowin i stay in motion

FIRST LAW

did you catch that
or did it go too fast to detect
perhaps it'd be better 
if i added in a bleep or a bloop
or another wacky sound effect

i was born on christmas
im gods gift
i unlocked the stars
that you're dancin with
you waste time debatin creationists
while i create the science
you explain to kids

//nye

yes it's true
what i used to do is teach kids science 
on my pbs show
but now i do
what i gotta do to make sure
scientific thought can grow
and i'm still in my prime
hittin my stride
what'd you do with the back half of your life
you freaked out
started countin coins for the bank
and you sure didn't have no wife
you wrote the book on gravity
but you couldn't attract no body
your work on orbits was exemplary
but your circle of friends was shoddy
you don't wanna mess
with the Guy Bill Nye
I rap sharp like a needle in your eye
stick to drinkin that mercury
cuz i hypothesize that you're about to get beat

//newton

well i conclude
that your methods are the wackest
you wouldn't even pass
in one of my classes
every action
has an equal and opposite reaction
except for when we both start rappin
i accelerated the mind of mankind
to higher plane of understanding and
i can calculate the weight
and the size and the shape
of the shadow of the mind you're standing in

and i will leave you with a page
from a book i wrote
at half your age to rebut

the integral sec y dy
from zero to one sixth of pi
is log to base e
of the square root of three
times the sixtyfourth power of whaat

//ngt

why don't you pick on a brain your own size
we got a badass over here
plus i got your back nye
astrophysics black guy
hayden planetary fly
by the way the answer
to your little calculation is i
as in i
put the swag back in science
while isaac newton was lyin
and stickin daggers in leibniz
and hiding upside his attic
on some Harry Potty business
the universe is infinite 
but this battle is finished
