# WRITING CONVENTIONS

### CAPITALIZATION OF NOUNS

Nouns may be capitalized for a variety of reasons. Most of the [FPMC Jargon](https://github.com/SplendidStrontium/splendidstrontium.github.io/wiki/FPMC-Jargon) will be capitalized to distinguish it as a created word. Other times words may be capitalized to provide emphasis; this often differs by character as well as medium.

### CHAT-BOXES

Chat-boxes generally indicate conversation over the wIntraNet but are also used with non-wIntraNet characters to denote phone and/or computer-based texting. In a very limited application, they may indicate telepathic communication.

### SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD

If I were a writer, it would be a hill on which I am willing to die.

### UNRELIABLE NARRATOR

None of the work should be considered as being from the omniscient point-of-view. All pieces are written from the perspective of the characters; the character named in the title should be considered the main character or point-of-view for that particular piece. The named character changes what is noticed or described as well as the style.

# IDEAS ON HOLD

Below is a collection of ideas that are on-hold for whatever reason. They aren't total junk but aren't a development priority.

### Bid-on-a-pie
I like baking so I thought it would be fun to have an open auction for a pastry as a fundraiser for the site. Ex. NANNY-C is going to make three pies this weekend. She opens bidding. Pie 1 is won by User A for $200. Pie 2 is won by User B for $150. Pie 3 is won by User C for $100. Pies are made and transferred to winners. Unsure whether this would be a local thing or if (oi) I'd try to use postal services. I like the idea but not feasible for release in the next few months. Plus it needs some idea refinement. [Closed issue](https://github.com/SplendidStrontium/splendidstrontium.github.io/issues/18) [upd: thu-apr-16-2020]

### Technicolor
I thought about putting a color theme on the site. But I don't know. Colors are... colorful. And I'm kind of getting attached to the B/W. Maybe someday I can have users able to set their own colors. [Closed issue](https://github.com/SplendidStrontium/splendidstrontium.github.io/issues/17) [upd: thu-apr-16-2020]
