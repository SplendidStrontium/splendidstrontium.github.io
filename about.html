	<p>You can call me Bianca Vacarescu.</p>
	
	<p>I have been writing since I learned how to hold a pencil. As a child, I wrote poems and short stories, and even dabbled in visual art. While my academic background is in the sciences, I nevertheless maintained a passion for creative writing as a way to document the human experience. I kept private journals for many years, and as I came into adulthood, I began to take more seriously the prospect and importance of sharing my perspective through writing.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">I am currently working on the eight-book fantasy series <em>The Convergent Eigenspace</em>, beginning with Book 0: <em>What Time Cannot Touch</em>.</p>
