	<h1>About the Author</h1>

	<p>You can call me Bianca Vacarescu. I am an author of fantasy fiction and developer of <em>The Convergent Eigenspace</em> series.</p>

	<p>I have been interested in writing since I learned how to hold a pencil. As a child, I wrote poems and short stories, and even dabbled in art. I have always had a voracious appetite for knowledge and an insatiable desire to understand the world. While my academic background is in the sciences, I nevertheless maintained a passion for creative writing as a way to document my perception of the human experience. I kept journals throughout my childhood and adolescence, and as I came into young adulthood, I began to take more seriously the prospect and importance of sharing my perspective through writing.</p>

	<p>I created this website as a means to publish my work while maintaining full creative freedom. Previous writing projects include experimental fiction, character studies, and narrative explorations across multiple genres and formats. I believe the line between traditional fantasy and science fiction is one that can and should be blurred. I also incorporate the real-life history of planet Earth into my work, and I feel many creations of fantasy can be just as impactful on our lives as the things we know from meatspace.</p>

	<p>I am currently working on the eight-book fantasy series <em>The Convergent Eigenspace</em>, beginning with Book 0: <em>What Time Cannot Touch</em>. This project represents a transition toward professional self-publishing and establishes the foundation for future literary work.</p>

	<h1>My Process</h1>

	<p>I like to have as much control as possible over what I say and how I say it. My early work is posted on this website, generated from text files composed with <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> and rendered with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on this <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> website. In 2025, I decided to modernize my workflow and make an effort at producing a traditional series of novels in the vein of the great classics I had grown up reading.</p>

	<p>I am using <a href="https://www.novelcrafter.com/">Novelcrafter</a> to write my new series. I will not be posting the contents of the novel on this website, but I will create supplementary materials that can only be obtained here.</p>

	<p>I maintain my own website and create all content as a solo project with some minor exceptions. Skits in the <a href="https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/">Femputer Manchine</a> series that are part of the <a href="https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/pidge/">Book of Pidge</a> are a record of a collaborative World of Darkness RPG conducted over Discord from 2022-23.</p>

	<h1>How I Use A.I.</h1>

	<p>I believe that generative A.I. and large language models, when used in accordance with law and morality, can help humanity and enrich our world. I also feel strongly that these are tools, like any other tools, and they must be used with caution and as appropriate. I would like to disclose the way in which I use A.I. to enhance my workflow and give credit where credit is due. I use Anthropic's <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude AI</a> as an assistant with various facets of my workflow. While I often use traditional methods for research, including books, newspapers, Internet searches, and other media, I use Claude to expand upon these sources. I may also use Claude to refine my word choices or to help with prose clarity. I use it only as a supplement, similar to how one might use a book on English style or a dictionary. I do not use A.I., either through Claude's desktop/mobile client, or the Novelcrafter A.I. integration tools, to write prose I intend to pass off as my own.</p>

	<p>I do use Claude to help me write code and maintain this website. I am not a web developer by trade and I have found Claude very useful to advise me on best practices and create ideas on how to craft a professional website. I may use it to help me draft very small bits of copy where my intention is to optimize clarity for a diverse set of readers. I do not allow the A.I. to write blog posts, this blurb, or any other long-form content. What you see here is my voice, warts and all.</p>
