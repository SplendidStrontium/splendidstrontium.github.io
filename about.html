	<p>You can call me Bianca Vacarescu.</p>
	
	<p>I have been writing since I learned how to hold a pencil. As a child, I wrote poems and short stories, and even dabbled in visual art. While my academic background is in the sciences, I nevertheless maintained a passion for creative writing as a way to document the human experience. I kept private journals for many years, and as I came into adulthood, I began to take more seriously the prospect and importance of sharing my perspective through writing.</p>

	<p>I created this website as a means to publish my stories while maintaining full creative freedom. I believe the line between traditional fantasy and science fiction is one that can and should be blurred. I also incorporate the real-life history of planet Earth into my work, and I feel many creations of fantasy can be just as impactful on our lives as the things we know from meatspace.</p>

	<p>I am currently working on the eight-book fantasy series <em>The Convergent Eigenspace</em>, beginning with Book 0: <em>What Time Cannot Touch</em>.</p>

	<h1>My Process</h1>

	<p>My early work is posted on this website, generated from text files composed with <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> and rendered with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on this <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> website. In 2025, I decided to produce a traditional series of novels in the vein of the great classics I had grown up reading. I am using <a href="https://www.novelcrafter.com/">Novelcrafter</a> to write my new series.</p>

	<p>I maintain my own website and create all content as a solo project with some minor exceptions. Skits in the <a href="https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/">Femputer Manchine</a> series that are part of the <a href="https://nan.nyc/femputermanchine/pidge/">Book of Pidge</a> are a record of a collaborative <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/world-of-darkness/about">World of Darkness</a> RPG conducted over Discord from 2022-23.</p>
